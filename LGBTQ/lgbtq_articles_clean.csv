Tobacco Control,2015,Disadvantaged youth and smoking in mature tobacco control contexts: a systematic review and synthesis of qualitative research,Review Article,"['gay', 'glbt']","Objective To review qualitative research and synthesise findings about socioeconomically disadvantaged and socially marginalised adolescents and young adults in mature tobacco control contexts. Data sources Searches of PubMed and MEDLINE, additional purposive searches in Google Scholar, PsycINFO, grey literature, specialist journals and reference lists for English language articles published after 2000. Search terms were qualitative, youth or adolescent or young adult, smoking/tobacco and vulnerable populations or disadvantage or socioeconomic inequality. The most recent update of the search was undertaken in January 2014. Study selection Twenty articles, reporting on 17 studies, from 902 initial records were included. Inclusion criteria were: qualitative study undertaken in a country in the final stage of the tobacco epidemic and with comprehensive tobacco control measures in place, participants were youth who were socioeconomically disadvantaged or members of an identified subgroup with higher smoking prevalence and/or resided in a geographical area of low socioeconomic status. The target age range was 10–24. Data extraction Data were independently extracted by one author, summarised and reviewed, compared and re-reviewed at multiple time points. Data synthesis The majority of studies were from the UK, with the remainder from the USA, Australia and New Zealand. The review used a thematic analysis approach, and started with an open question: ‘what does qualitative research tell us about disadvantaged young people and smoking?’ The synthesis provides insights into the social context of smoking for marginalised and disadvantaged young people, group affiliation and identity, the role of smoking in social capital and sources of cigarettes. Conclusions Surprisingly few qualitative studies focused exclusively on smoking and disadvantaged young people were found. Future qualitative studies on the intersection between specific psychosocial characteristics associated with disadvantage and increased smoking risk would be of use to inform approaches to reduce socioeconomic differentials in smoking prevalence.","Electronic database search strategies January 2014 MEDLINE via OvidSP 1. Youth.mp as keyword or Adolescent/ 2. Qualitative Research/ or qualitative.mp as keyword 3. Smoking/ 4. 1 and 2 and 3 PubMed 1. Youth and 2. Qualitative and 3. Smoking Terms such as ‘deprived/deprivation’, ‘disadvantaged’, ‘socio-economic inequality’ and ‘socially marginalised’ were excluded from the initial MEDLINE and PubMed searches to avoid screening out potentially eligible articles.

What purpose does smoking serve for young people at risk of self-harm? Which contextual factors are the most important in determining smoking trajectories of disadvantaged young people? What are the factors that promote not smoking among young people with cumulative and severe disadvantage? Disadvantaged and socially marginalised young people in countries with advanced tobacco control have significantly higher smoking prevalence than other young people. Qualitative research is important for explaining the processes by which risk factors and contextual differences create these disparities, and to provide insights for effective policies and interventions. This is the first systematic review of qualitative research focused on disadvantaged and marginalised young people and smoking.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051756,Marita Hefler; Simon Chapman;,"A27-School of Public Health, University of Sydney; A27-School of Public Health, University of Sydney;",,,1,1,
Tobacco Control,2016,Peer crowd affiliation as a segmentation tool for young adult tobacco use,Research Article,"['sex', 'sexual orientation']","Background In California, young adult tobacco prevention is of prime importance; 63% of smokers start by the age of 18 years, and 97% start by the age of 26 years. We examined social affiliation with ‘peer crowd’ (eg, Hipsters) as an innovative way to identify high-risk tobacco users. Methods Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2014 (N=3368) among young adult bar patrons in 3 California cities. We examined use rates of five products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, hookah, cigars and smokeless tobacco) by five race/ethnicity categories. Peer crowd affiliation was scored based on respondents' selecting pictures of young adults representing those most and least likely to be in their friend group. Respondents were classified into categories based on the highest score; the peer crowd score was also examined as a continuous predictor. Logistic regression models with each tobacco product as the outcome tested the unique contribution of peer crowd affiliation, controlling for race/ethnicity, age, sex, sexual orientation and city. Results Respondents affiliating with Hip Hop and Hipster peer crowds reported significantly higher rates of tobacco use. As a categorical predictor, peer crowd was related to tobacco use, independent of associations with race/ethnicity. As a continuous predictor, Hip Hop peer crowd affiliation was also associated with tobacco use, and Young Professional affiliation was negatively associated, independent of demographic factors. Conclusions Tobacco product use is not the same across racial/ethnic groups or peer crowds, and peer crowd predicts tobacco use independent of race/ethnicity. Antitobacco interventions targeting peer crowds may be an effective way to reach young adult tobacco users. Trial registration number NCT01686178, Pre-results.","Young adults use tobacco at high rates, but few studies examine the role of identity and social cultures (eg, peer crowd affiliation) in addition to sociodemographic factors associated with tobacco use despite their common use in marketing campaigns to promote tobacco use. This study found that affiliation with different peer crowds was associated with smoking, independent of race/ethnicity, age, sexual orientation and education. This study also examined multiple non-cigarette tobacco products (e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and smokeless tobacco) and found that peer crowd was independently associated with use of almost all alternative products. Peer crowd affiliation adds additional information to demographics in order to better characterize high risk subgroups of young adults and facilitate development of targeted anti-tobacco campaigns that reflect group membership and values.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053086,Nadra E Lisha; Jeffrey W Jordan; Pamela M Ling;,"Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, University of California San Francisco; Rescue; Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, University of California San Francisco;",,,1,1,
Tobacco Control,2017,Misperceptions of harm among Natural American Spirit smokers: results from wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (2013–2014),Research Article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'questioning', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction This study estimated differences in cigarette harm perceptions among smokers of the Natural American Spirit (NAS) brand—marketed as ‘natural’, ‘organic’ and ‘additive-free’—compared to other smokers, and examined correlates of NAS use. Methods Data were drawn from wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study, a nationally representative study of US adults (2013–2014). Weighted analyses using a subset of current adult smokers (n=10 565) estimated the prevalence of NAS use (vs all other brands) and examined associations between NAS use and sociodemographics, tobacco/substance use, tobacco harm perceptions, quit intentions, quit attempts and mental/behavioural health. Results Overall, 2.3% of adult smokers (920 000 people in the USA) reported NAS as their usual brand. Nearly 64% of NAS smokers inaccurately believed that their brand is less harmful than other brands compared to 8.3% of smokers of other brands, after controlling for potential confounders (aOR 22.82). Younger age (18–34 vs 35+; aOR 1.54), frequent thinking about tobacco harms (aOR 1.84), past 30-day alcohol use (aOR 1.57), past 30-day marijuana use (aOR 1.87) and sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, ‘other’ or ‘questioning’ vs heterosexual; aOR 2.07) were also associated with increased odds of smoking NAS. Conclusions The majority of NAS smokers inaccurately believes that their cigarettes are less harmful than other brands. Given the brand's rapid growth and its more common use in vulnerable groups (eg, young adults, lesbian, gay, bisexual, ‘other’ or ‘questioning’ adults), corrective messaging and enforcement action are necessary to correct harm misperceptions of NAS cigarettes.","Prior research has revealed that Natural American Spirit (NAS) cigarette pack descriptors and advertising convey reduced harm messages to study participants. Using recent (2013–2014) nationally representative data from the USA, this study shows that, compared to smokers of other brands, NAS smokers are over 22 times more likely to inaccurately believe that their brand is less harmful than other brands. NAS smokers are more likely to be young adults, non-Hispanic White, college educated, past 30-day marijuana and alcohol users, and identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, ‘other’ or ‘questioning’ than smokers of other brands.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053265,Jennifer L Pearson; Amanda Johnson; Andrea Villanti; Allison M Glasser; Lauren Collins; Amy Cohn; Shyanika W Rose; Raymond Niaura; Cassandra A Stanton;,"Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Georgetown University Medical Center/Cancer Prevention and Control Program, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Truth Initiative; Georgetown University Medical Center/Cancer Prevention and Control Program, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; Westat;",,,1,1,
Tobacco Control,2020,"Deaths from smoking and from HIV/AIDS among gay and bisexual men in California, 2005–2050",Research Article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'lgbt', 'men who have sex with men', 'sex', 'transgender']","Introduction Deaths from HIV/AIDS have long been of concern to the gay community, but less attention has focused on smoking-attributable deaths despite the relatively high smoking rates among gay and bisexual men. This study compared deaths from HIV/AIDS with smoking-attributable deaths among California gay and bisexual men from 2005 to 2050. Methods Smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) were estimated using smoking prevalence for gay and bisexual men from the 2011–2014 California Health Interview Surveys and published relative risks of death. Smoking-attributable deaths were calculated by multiplying the SAFs by deaths among gay and bisexual men. Deaths from HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men was obtained from the California Department of Public Health. Future deaths from smoking and HIV/AIDS were projected using regression equations based on time trends. Results From 2005 to 2014, smoking caused over 6800 deaths among gay and bisexual men, while nearly 9500 died from HIV/AIDS. Mortality from both causes has been falling, but deaths from HIV/AIDS have been falling more rapidly. Projections suggest that in the mid-2040s, more gay/bisexual men will die from smoking than from HIV/AIDS. Conclusion Smoking will surpass HIV/AIDS as a cause of death among gay and bisexual men in California within a few decades. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community was highly effective in drawing attention and resources to the fight against HIV/AIDS, saving untold lives by hastening effective treatments. Lessons learnt in the fight against AIDS should be used to help fight the tobacco epidemic.","One in five deaths in the USA is attributable to smoking. Gay and bisexual men smoke at higher rates than heterosexual men, suggesting that many of them may be victims of smoking-attributable mortality. The mortality toll of cigarette smoking on the gay and bisexual community has not been studied. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, which mobilised effectively against the AIDS epidemic, has largely ignored the tobacco epidemic. We found that smoking-attributable deaths will exceed deaths from AIDS in the California gay/bisexual community within a few decades. The LGBT community could build on its successful organising against AIDS to help diminish the toll of tobacco.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054850,Wendy B Max; Brad B Stark; Hai-Yen Sung; Naphtali B Offen;,"Institute for Health and Aging; University of California, San Francisco; Institute for Health and Aging; University of California, San Francisco; Institute for Health and Aging; University of California, San Francisco; San Francisco, California, USA;",,,1,1,
Tobacco Control,2020,Correlates of tobacco product reuptake and relapse among youth and adults in the USA: findings from the PATH Study Waves 1–3 (2013–2016),Research Article,"['bisexual', 'sexual orientation']","Objective This study examines sociodemographic and tobacco use correlates of reuptake and relapse to tobacco use across a variety of tobacco products (cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems, cigars, hookah and smokeless tobacco) among the US population. Design Data were drawn from the first three waves (2013–2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort study of US youth (ages 12–17) and adults (ages 18+). Reuptake (past 30-day use among previous tobacco users) and relapse (current use among former established users; adults only) were examined among previous users of at least one type of tobacco product at Wave 1 (W1) or Wave 2 (W2) (n=19 120 adults, n=3039 youth). Generalised estimating equations were used to evaluate the association between demographic and tobacco use characteristics at baseline, with reuptake/relapse at follow-up, over two 1-year periods (W1–W2 and W2–Wave 3). Results Any tobacco product reuptake occurred in 7.8% of adult previous users and 30.3% of youth previous users. Correlates of any tobacco reuptake included being male, non-Hispanic black and bisexual in adults, but race and sexual orientation were not consistent findings in youth. Among recent former users, relapse rates were greater (32.9%). Shorter time since last use and greater levels of tobacco dependence showed the strongest association with any tobacco relapse. Discussion Continued clinical and public health efforts to provide adults with tools to cope with tobacco dependence symptoms, especially within the first year or two after quitting, could help prevent relapse.","Understanding the sociodemographic and tobacco use factors associated with reuptake and relapse to different tobacco products fills a large gap in the primarily cigarette-focused literature. This study evaluates the sociodemographic and tobacco use correlates of tobacco product reuptake among youth (ages 12–17) and adults (ages 18+) and tobacco product relapse among adults across any tobacco and specific classes of tobacco products available in the USA. Over a 1-year period, reuptake was less than 8% for all products except ENDS (16%) among adults, and higher for youth (between 15% and 25% across products). Correlates of any tobacco reuptake included being male, non-Hispanic black and bisexual in adults, but race and sexual orientation were not consistent findings in youth. These correlates among adults are similar to those seen in tobacco product initiation. Among adults, relapse rates were similar to reuptake. Relapse rates were higher (15%–28% across products) when restricting our analyses to recent (within the past 12 months) former established users. Shorter time since last use and greater levels of tobacco dependence showed the strongest association with any tobacco relapse. Continued clinical and public health efforts to provide adults with tools to cope with tobacco dependence, especially within the first year or two after quitting, could help prevent relapse to both cigarette and non-cigarette tobacco products.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-055660,Kathryn C Edwards; Karin A Kasza; Zhiqun Tang; Cassandra A Stanton; Eva Sharma; Michael J Halenar; Kristie A Taylor; Elisabeth A Donaldson; Lynn C Hull; Maansi Bansal-Travers; Jean Limpert; Izabella Zandberg; Lisa D Gardner; Nicolette Borek; Heather L Kimmel; Wilson M Compton; Andrew Hyland;,"Behavioral Health and Health Policy Practice; Westat; Department of Health Behavior; Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center; Behavioral Health and Health Policy Practice; Westat; Behavioral Health and Health Policy Practice; Westat; Department of Oncology; Georgetown University Medical Center; Behavioral Health and Health Policy Practice; Westat; Behavioral Health and Health Policy Practice; Westat; Behavioral Health and Health Policy Practice; Westat; Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products; Food and Drug Administration; Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products; Food and Drug Administration; Department of Health Behavior; Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center; Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products; Food and Drug Administration; Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products; Food and Drug Administration; Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products; Food and Drug Administration; Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products; Food and Drug Administration; National Institute on Drug Abuse; National Institutes of Health; National Institute on Drug Abuse; National Institutes of Health; Department of Health Behavior; Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center;",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Smoking Among Sexual Minorities: Are There Racial Differences?,article,"['gender', 'heterosexual', 'sexual minorities', 'sexual minority']","Introduction: Smoking prevalence is higher among sexual minorities compared to their heterosexual peers. However, very little is known about potential racial differences in smoking among sexual minority populations. We examined differences by race in smoking status among a robust sample of sexual minorities. Methods: We used data from the 2010 Social Justice Sexuality project, a large national convenience sample of sexual minority adults that oversampled individuals from racial minority groups. Log-Poisson multivariable regression models were employed to determine the risk of current smoking among sexual minority individuals by race after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Results: Among smokers, 22.35% identified as White, 26.98% identified as Black, 19.38% identified as Latino/Hispanic, 5.58% identified as Asian American, and 25.67% were other/multiracial. In fully adjusted gender stratified models, Black men (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50, 0.75) and Asian American men (aRR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.75) were at lower risk of smoking compared to White men. Black women were the only to remain statistically significant for decreased risk of smoking in fully adjusted gender stratified models (aRR = 0.78, 95 % CI = 0.65, 0.95). Conclusions: Among sexual minorities, Black and Asian American individuals consistently were at decreased risk of current smoking compared to their White peers. Future research should seek to understand the mechanisms that contribute to decreased smoking status among racial sexual minorities.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntv001,"Ortiz, Kasim S.; Duncan, Dustin T.; Blosnich, John R.; Salloum, Ramzi G.; Battle, Juan","Department of Sociology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY; VA Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Pittsburgh, PA; Department of Health Services Policy and Management, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC; Departments of Sociology, Public Health and Urban Education, City University of New York, New York, NY",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Social Branding to Decrease Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Young Adult Smoking",article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'gender', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'lgbt', 'straight', 'transgender']","Introduction: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals are more likely to smoke than the general population. This study evaluated a Social Branding intervention, CRUSH, which included an aspirational brand, social events, and targeted media to discourage smoking among LGBT young adults in Las Vegas, NV. Methods: Cross-sectional surveys (N = 2,395) were collected in Las Vegas LGBT bars at 2 time points 1 year apart. Multivariate logistic regressions examined associations between campaign exposure, message understanding, and current (past 30 days) smoking, controlling for demographics. Results: LGBT individuals were significantly more likely to report current (past 30 day) smoking than heterosexual/straight, gender-conforming participants. Overall, 53% of respondents reported exposure to CRUSH; of those exposed, 60% liked the campaign, 60.3% reported they would attend a CRUSH event on a night when they usually went somewhere else, and 86.3% correctly identified that the campaign was about “partying fresh and smokefree.” Current smoking was reported by 47% of respondents at Time 1 and 39.6% at Time 2. There were significant interactions between time and campaign exposure and campaign exposure and understanding the message. Among those who understood the CRUSH smokefree message, the highest level of campaign exposure was significantly associated with 37%–48% lower odds for current smoking. Conclusions: While longitudinal studies would better assess the impact of this intervention, CRUSH shows promise to reduce tobacco use among LGBT bar patrons.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntu265,"Fallin, Amanda; Neilands, Torsten B.; Jordan, Jeffrey W.; Ling, Pamela M.","Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Rescue Social Change Group, San Diego, CA; Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Is There a Relationship Between the Concentration of Same-Sex Couples and Tobacco Retailer Density?,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'same-sex', 'sex']","Background: Tobacco use is markedly higher among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations than heterosexuals. Higher density of tobacco retailers is found in neighborhoods with lower income and more racial/ethnic minorities. Same-sex couples tend to live in similar neighborhoods, but the association of this demographic with tobacco retailer density has not been examined. Methods:  For a national sample of 97 US counties, we calculated the number of tobacco retailers per 1000 persons and rates of same-sex couples per 1000 households in each census tract ( n = 17 941). Using spatial regression, we examined the association of these variables in sex-stratified models, including neighborhood demographics and other environmental characteristics to examine confounding.  Results: Results from spatial regression show that higher rates of both female and male same-sex couples were associated with a higher density of tobacco retailers. However the magnitude of this association was small. For female couples, the association was not significant after controlling for area-level characteristics, such as percent black, percent Hispanic, median household income, the presence of interstate highways, and urbanicity, which are neighborhood correlates of higher tobacco retailer density. For male couples, the association persisted after control for these characteristics. Conclusion: Same-sex couples reside in areas with higher tobacco retailer density, and for men, this association was not explained by neighborhood confounders, such as racial/ethnic composition and income. While lesbian, gay, and bisexual disparities in tobacco use may be influenced by neighborhood environment, the magnitude of the association suggests other explanations of these disparities remain important areas of research.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntv046,"Lee, Joseph G.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Minority Stress, Smoking Patterns, and Cessation Attempts: Findings From a Community-Sample of Transgender Women in the San Francisco Bay Area",article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'transgender']","Introduction: Research has demonstrated associations between reports of minority stressors and smoking behaviors among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations; however, little is known about how minority stressors are related to smoking behaviors and cessation attempts among transgender women. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the associations between transgender-based discrimination and smoking patterns among a sample of transgender women; and (2) to identify barriers to smoking cessation in a sample of transgender women with a history of smoking. Methods: A community sample of 241 transgender women completed a one-time survey. Binary and multinomial logistic regression models examined associations between minority stressors and (1) smoking behaviors and (2) cessation attempts. Both models adjusted for income, education, race/ethnicity, recent sex work, HIV status, depression, alcohol use, and current hormone use. Results:  Overall, 83% of participants indicated that they had smoked a cigarette in the last month. Of these women, 62.3% reported daily smoking and 51.7% reported an unsuccessful quit attempt. Discrimination was positively associated with currently smoking (adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.08). Discrimination was positively associated with unsuccessful cessation ( AOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.18) and never attempting ( AOR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.11) compared to successful cessation. Discrimination was also positively associated with never attempting compared to unsuccessful cessation ( AOR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.03).  Conclusions: Smoking cessation may be driven by unique transgender-related minority stressors, such as discrimination.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) adults are a vulnerable population that smokes at higher rates than heterosexuals. Methods:  We used data collected from the National Adult Tobacco Survey 2009–2010, a large, nationally representative study using a randomized, national sample of US landline and cellular telephone listings, ( N = 118 590). We compared LGBT adults to their heterosexual counterparts with regard to exposure to advertisements promoting smoking cessation, and awareness and use of tobacco treatment services, including quitlines, smoking cessation classes, health professional counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and medications.  Results: Fewer GBT men, compared to heterosexual men, were aware of the quitline. However, LGBT individuals have similar exposure to tobacco cessation advertising, as well as similar awareness of and use of evidence based cessation methods as compared to heterosexual peers. Conclusions: The similarly of awareness and use of cessation support indicates a need for LGBT-specific efforts to reduce smoking disparities. Potential interventions would include: improving awareness of, access to and acceptability of current cessation methods for LGBT patients, developing tailored cessation interventions, and denormalizing smoking in LGBT community spaces.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntv103,"Fallin, Amanda; Lee, Youn Ok; Bennett, Keisa; Goodin, Amie","Tobacco Policy Research Program, College of Nursing, University of Kentucky , Lexington, KY ;  Public Health Research Division, RTI International , Research Triangle Park, NC ;  Department of Family and Community Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky , Lexington, KY ;  Institute for Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Kentucky , Lexington, KY",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Awareness and Use of Dissolvable Tobacco Products in the United States,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'lgbt', 'transgender']","Introduction: Little is known about dissolvable tobacco products (DTPs) compared with other alternative tobacco products (ATPs) like e-cigarettes and snus. We sought to understand US adults’ awareness and use of DTPs. Methods:  A nationally representative sample of US adults (age ≥ 18 years, N = 17 522) completed an online survey in March 2013 assessing their awareness and use of DTPs.  Results: Approximately 16% of all respondents were aware of DTPs. Few reported ever using DTPs (1.6%). DTP awareness among all respondents was greatest among males, younger adults, current and former smokers, never married respondents, blacks and Latinos, and those who used other ATPs. Among current smokers, DTP awareness was greatest for males, younger adults, blacks and Latinos, those who used other ATPs, and Southerners. DTP use among all respondents was greatest among males, younger adults, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) respondents, former and current smokers, and those who used other ATPs. Among current smokers, DTP use was greatest among males, younger adults, LGBT respondents, those who used other ATPs, those who intended to quit, and those who received medical advice to quit. Conclusions: DTP awareness and use have increased since 2009. DTPs are being used as smoking cessation aids thereby increasing risk of polytobacco use. Medical professionals should emphasize use of empirically-supported smoking cessation aids when advising patients to quit. Regulations are needed to prevent tobacco company promotion of DTPs as smoking cessation aids and to inform consumers of the risks associated with DTPs and polytobacco use. Increased national surveillance of DTP use is recommended.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntv212,"Cabrera-Nguyen, E.

Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations are at increased risk for cigarette smoking, but research on LGB subpopulations’ use of tobacco products beyond cigarettes and tobacco use differences across LGB subgroups is in its infancy. This study explores differences in use of tobacco products across LGB subgroups, including gender differences among bisexuals. Methods: This study reports results from a 2013 nationally-representative cross-sectional online survey of US adults (N = 17 087). Weighted tobacco use prevalence and adjusted logistic regression results are reported. Results: LGB populations reported higher current use of any tobacco product (35.7%) and current use of cigarettes (32.0%), e-cigarettes (8.9%), regular (5.5%) and small cigars (11.6%), compared with non-LGB. Bisexual (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7–3.9) and lesbian (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0–2.7) women have higher odds of any tobacco use than heterosexual women; including greater odds of regular (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.2–7.0 and OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3–3.9; respectively) and small cigar use (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.4–4.1 and OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 2.0–5.1; respectively). Gay men had lower odds of cigar use (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2–0.8) than heterosexual men. Conclusions: This is the first US adult population study to assess differences in use of various tobacco products across adult LGB subpopulations and by gender, confirming their increased risk of use and illuminating differences by subgroup and gender. Exploring LGB as a unified population appears inadequate to accurately characterize LGB tobacco use risk. Tobacco-related LGB health inequities, particularly among bisexual and lesbian women, may be greater than previously indicated. Implications: This manuscript provides important contributions to the field of tobacco control and prevention, and more specifically to LGB tobacco-related health disparities research. This is among the first population level studies to explore various tobacco use across LGB populations and across genders, comparing results to non-LGB populations in a national study. We provide novel evidence that bisexual women in particular, have a higher risk for use of various tobacco products, compared with other LGB subpopulations. In order to address this disparity, tobacco control professionals need to be made aware of these important differences in tobacco use behavior.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntv208,"Emory, Kristen; Kim, Yoonsang; Buchting, Francisco; Vera, Lisa; Huang, Jidong; Emery, Sherry L.","Health Media Collaboratory, Institute for Health Research and Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL; Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; Health Media Collaboratory, Institute for Health Research and Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL; Moores Cancer Center, Horizons Foundation, San Francisco, CA Health Media Collaboratory, Institute for Health Research and Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL; Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; Health Media Collaboratory, Institute for Health Research and Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL; Health Media Collaboratory, Institute for Health Research and Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL;",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Structural Discrimination is Associated With Smoking Status Among a National Sample of Transgender Individuals,article,"['gender', 'gender identity', 'transgender']","Introduction: Limited evidence suggests that transgender individuals smoke at significantly higher rates than the general population. We aimed to determine whether structural or everyday discrimination experiences predict smoking behavior among transgender individuals when sociodemographic, health, and gender-specific factors were controlled. Methods: Data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 4781), a cross-sectional online and paper survey distributed to organizations serving the transgender community, were analyzed in order to determine the association between current smoking and discrimination experiences and other potential predictors. Logistic regression models were used to establish factors that predict smoking. Results: Participants reported experiencing both structural (80.4%) and everyday (65.9%) discrimination. Multivariate analyses showed that participants who reported attending some college, graduating college, or having a graduate degree were less likely to smoke compared to those with a high school degree or less. Uninsured participants were more likely to report smoking compared to those with private insurance. Those who used alcohol or drugs for coping were also more likely to smoke. Participants whose IDs and records listed their preferred gender were less likely to smoke (OR = 0.84); those who had experienced structural discrimination were more like to report smoking (OR = 1.65). Conclusions: Further research is needed in order to explore the relationship between smoking and legal transition among transgender individuals. Strategies to prevent smoking and encourage cessation among this vulnerable population are also needed. In addition, comprehensive collection of gender identity data in the context of national surveys, tobacco-related research, and clinical settings is sorely needed. Implications: This study establishes a link between experiences of structural discrimination among transgender individuals and smoking status.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntv221,"Shires, Deirdre A.; Jaffee, Kim D.","School of Social Work, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI School of Social Work, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Can Smoke-Free Policies Reduce Tobacco Use Disparities of Sexual and Gender Minorities in Missouri?,article,"['gender', 'gender minority', 'sexual and gender minority']","Objective The purpose of this study is to explore the associations between smoke-free policies, current and former smoking status, personal smoking restrictions, and intention to quit among sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM individuals in Missouri. Aims and Methods The current analysis derives from the Out, Proud and Healthy project. Chi-squares examined differences between SGM (N = 2210) and non-SGM (N = 586) respondents and former (N = 836) and current (N = 1960) smokers on smoking-related variables. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from logistic regression identified variables associated with former (vs. current) smoking. Results SGM current smokers (25%) were significantly more likely than SGM former smokers (19%) to live in a community without a smoke-free policy. Among SGM current smokers, significantly greater intention to quit was seen in those living in a smoke-free community with a smoke-free policy of two or more years (94%) compared with those living in a community without a smoke-free policy (76%). Conclusions Living in an area with smoke-free policies is related to greater intention to quit among SGM current smokers, greater support for smoke-free policies, and lower smoking prevalence for this community. The SGM community may collectively accrue greater public health benefits from the adoption of smoke-free policies than the non-SGM community. Implications Prior to this study, no data are available regarding current and former smoking status among SGM individuals following the implementation of a local smoke-free policy. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between smoke-free policies, current and former smoking status, and intention to quit among SGM and non-SGM individuals in Missouri. This study finds evidence of lower current smoking prevalence and greater intentions to quit among SGM current smokers who live in communities with smoke-free policies.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,"Smoking Cessation Programs for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex People: A Content-Based Systematic Review",article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'intersex', 'lesbian', 'lesbians', 'lgbt', 'transgender']","Introduction Tobacco use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is double the general population. Limited evidence suggests high smoking rates among intersex people. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people are a priority population in Australian health policy, particularly mental health and aging. Despite associations between smoking and noncommunicable diseases relevant to aging and mental health, LGBTI-targeted smoking cessation interventions in Australia have been limited to people living with HIV. Applying existing interventions to marginalized populations without modification and evaluation may fail and exacerbate inequities. Aims To assess outcomes and characterize the populations served, cultural modifications, and behavior change techniques (BCTs) of interventions to reduce LGBTI smoking. Methods We searched MEDLINE, six additional databases, and contacted authors to retrieve published and unpublished program evaluations. Results We retrieved 19 studies (3663 participants). None used control groups. Overall quit rate was 61.0% at the end of interventions and stabilized at 38.6% at 3–6 months. All studies included gay men, 13 included lesbians, 13 “LGBT,” 12 bisexual people, five transgender people, and none included intersex people. Transgender people comprised 3% of participants. Of programs open to women, 27.8% of participants were women. Cultural modifications were used by 17 (89.5%) studies, commonly meeting in LGBT spaces, discussing social justice, and discussing LGBT-specific triggers. Common BCTs included providing normative information, boosting motivation/self-efficacy, relapse prevention, social support, action planning, and discussing consequences. Conclusions Quit rates were high; using control groups would improve evaluation. Existing programs may fail to reach groups other than gay men. Implications This review examines the evidence for LGBTI-targeted smoking cessation interventions. Populations within LGBTI are not proportionally represented in smoking cessation research, and no study addressed intersex smoking. Overall, LGBT-targeted interventions appear to be effective, and simply having an LGBT-specific group may be more effective than groups for the general population. More rigorous research is necessary to draw firm conclusions. Our study space analysis provides suggestions for areas of more targeted research on mechanisms underlying these complex interventions’ success.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntw216,"Berger, Israel; Mooney-Somers, Julie","Centre for Values, Ethics and Law in Medicine (VELiM), Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia Centre for Values, Ethics and Law in Medicine (VELiM), Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,LGBTQ Youth and Young Adult Perspectives on a Culturally Tailored Group Smoking Cessation Program,article,"['lgbtq', 'non-lgbtq']","Introduction The prevalence of smoking among LGBTQ youth and young adults (YYAs) is much higher than that of non-LGBTQ young people. The current study explored LGBTQ YYA perceptions of a culturally tailored group smoking cessation counselling program, along with how the intervention could be improved. Methods We conducted focus groups (n = 24) with 204 LGBTQ YYAs in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. Open-ended questions focused on their feelings, likes and dislikes, concerns and additional ideas for a culturally tailored group cessation counselling intervention. Focus group transcripts were coded thematically and analyzed. Results Overall, YYAs were ambivalent towards the concept of a culturally tailored, group cessation counselling program. Although several participants were attracted to the LGBTQ friendly and social benefits of such a program (eg, good support system), many also had concerns. Particularly, the possibility that other group members might trigger them to smoke was a frequently stated issue. Focus group members also noted lack of motivation to attend the group, and that the group program may be inaccessible depending on where and when the program was offered. Several suggestions were made as to how to ameliorate the expressed issues related to inaccessibility or lack of attractiveness. Conclusions This study is among the first to gain the perspectives of LGBTQ YYAs on culturally tailored group cessation strategies in Canada. We identified components of group cessation programs that are both favored and not favored among LGBTQ YYAs, as well as suggestions as to how to make group cessation programs more appealing. Implications This study is particularly relevant as smoking cessation programs are one of the most commonly offered and published cessation interventions for the LGBTQ community, yet little is understood in terms of preferences of LGBTQ YYA smokers. Given the disparity in the prevalence of smoking among LGBTQ young people compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, research on effective intervention strategies for this population is needed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Effects of Sexual Orientation on the Relationship Between Victimization Experiences and Smoking Status Among US Women,article,"['bisexual', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'sexual minority', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction This study examined the relationships between experiences of childhood and adulthood victimization and current smoking among heterosexual and sexual minority women. The main hypothesis was that victimization experiences would predict current smoking status. Further, we hypothesized that the effect of childhood victimization on self-reported smoker status would be mediated by adult victimization. Methods Data are from two studies conducted in the United States that used similar methods and questionnaires in order to conduct a comparative analysis of women based on sexual orientation. Data from Wave 1 (2000–2001) of the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women (CHLEW) study and from Wave 5 (2001) of the National Study of Health and Life Experiences of Women (NSHLEW) study were used in these analyses. Results Twenty-eight percent of the sample reported current smoking. Victimization experiences were common, with 63.4% of participants reporting at least one type of victimization in childhood and 40.2% reporting at least one type in adulthood. Women who identified as heterosexual were less likely to be victimized during childhood than were women who identified as lesbian or bisexual. Adult victimization had a significant effect on current smoker status, and the effect of childhood victimization on smoker status was mediated by adult victimization. When examined by sexual orientation, this indirect relationship remained significant only among bisexual women in the sample. Conclusions Study findings make a valuable contribution to the literature on victimization and health risk behaviors such as smoking. Given the negative and long-term impact of victimization on women, strategies are needed that reduce the likelihood of victimization and subsequent engagement in health risk behaviors such as smoking. Implications The study findings make a valuable contribution to the literature on sexual minority women’s health on the influence of victimization on health risk behaviors. With the goal of reducing the likelihood of adult victimization and subsequent engagement in health risk behaviors, programs and policies aimed at preventing victimization of women are warranted. Providers and community health agencies should assess and target physically and sexually abused sexual minority youth for mental health intervention with the goal of interrupting the progression from childhood victimization to adult victimization and subsequent engagement in health risk behaviors.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntx052,"Matthews, Alicia K; Cho, Young Ik; Hughes, Tonda L; Wilsnack, Sharon C; Aranda, Frances; Johnson, Timothy","Department of Health Systems Sciences, College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL Department of community and behavioral health promotion, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, Zilber School of Public Health, Community and Behavioral Health Promotion, Milwaukee, WI Department of Health Systems Sciences, College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND Rush University Medical Center, Department of Behavioral Studies, Chicago, IL Department of Behavioral Studies, Survey Research Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Frequent Experience of LGBQ Microaggression on Campus Associated With Smoking Among Sexual Minority College Students,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'gender', 'gender minority', 'lesbian', 'lgbq', 'queer', 'questioning', 'sexual and gender minority', 'sexual minorities', 'sexual minority']","Introduction Lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer/questioning (LGBQ) microaggressions refer to often-unintentional insults, assaults, and invalidations that denigrate sexual minorities. While experiencing hostile discrimination and violence has previously been associated with elevated rates of smoking cigarettes for LGBQ college students, the relationship between LGBQ microaggressions and smoking is unknown. Methods Data from a national anonymous online survey of sexual and gender minority college students were used to examine the relationship between past month cigarette smoking and interpersonal LGBQ microaggressions. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the relationship between smoking and frequent (chronic) experiences of microaggressions, using a hierarchical procedure to control for demographics, predictors of smoking, and academic factors. Results Past year frequent LGBQ microaggression was reported by 48% of respondents and was more common among students who smoked in past 30 days. Experiencing past year physical violence was reported by 15% and did not differ by smoking status. Past year frequent experience of microaggressions was associated with increased odds of 1.72 (95% CI 1.03–2.87) for past 30-day smoking after adjusting for age, gender, race, socioeconomic indicators, alcohol misuse, physical violence, as well as academic stress and engagement. Conclusions The results indicate that frequently experiencing LGBQ microaggressions is a risk factor for LGBQ college students smoking cigarettes. The mechanisms underlying this relationship require additional research, as does identifying positive coping strategies and institutional strategies to address LGBQ microaggressions on campuses. Tobacco control efforts should consider the impact of microaggression on the social environment for the prevention and treatment of tobacco use among LGBQ individuals. Implications Microaggressions related to sexual minority identity include subtle forms of discrimination experienced during daily interactions that can create hostile and stressful social environments for a socially disadvantaged group. Prior research has demonstrated that LGBQ college students have higher rates of cigarette smoking, and that experiencing identity-based violence is a risk factor. This study revealed that experiencing frequent LGBQ microaggressions on college campus is associated with increased likelihood of current smoking among LGBQ college students.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntw305,"Ylioja, Thomas; Cochran, Gerald; Woodford, Michael R; Renn, Kristen A","School of Social Work, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA School of Social Work, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA Lyle S.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Sexual and Gender Minority College Students and Tobacco Use in Texas,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'gender', 'gender minority', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'queer', 'sexual and gender minority', 'transgender']","Introduction Most research regarding sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations is limited to examination of cigarette or general tobacco use or does not examine heterogeneity across SGM groups other than lesbian or gay and bisexual individuals. This study examined differences in the odds of current use and age of initiation of five tobacco/nicotine products among three groups of SGM young adults who self-identified as (1) gay or lesbian, (2) bisexual, and (3) queer, transgender, or “other,” compared to their heterosexual peers. Methods Participants were 4252 college students aged 18–29 years from 24 colleges in Texas who completed an online tobacco use survey. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the odds of SGM participants currently using each tobacco product. Multilevel linear regression models were used to examine the association of current product users’ SGM status with self-reported age of each product’s initiation. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and accounted for students clustered within each college. Results At least one SGM group had significantly greater odds of currently using every tobacco product type compared to heterosexual participants, except hookah. There were few differences across groups in age of initiation. However, queer, transgender, and “other-” identified participants initiated e-cigarettes 1.34 years younger than heterosexual participants, and bisexual participants initiated smokeless tobacco 3.66 years younger than heterosexual participants. Conclusions Findings highlight some significant tobacco use disparities among SGM young adults compared to their heterosexual peers. Longitudinal studies with larger group sizes will identify prospective predictors of sustained SGM-related tobacco use disparities. Implications This study extends the current literature by including the sexual and gender minority identity options of queer, transgender, and “other,” highlighting disparities in tobacco use between young adults in these subgroups compared to their heterosexual peers, particularly in noncigarette tobacco product use. Findings underscore the need for the Food and Drug Association and other health agencies to tailor health communication efforts specific to sexual and gender minority populations pertaining to the risks and harms surrounding tobacco product use.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntx095,"Hinds, Josephine T; Loukas, Alexandra; Perry, Cheryl L","Department of Kinesiology and Health Education, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX Department of Kinesiology and Health Education, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX The Michael & Susan Dell Center for Healthy Living, UTHealth School of Public Health, Austin Campus, Austin, TX",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,"Association of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Facets With Smoking Dependence Motives",article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'lgb', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults have higher rates of smoking than heterosexual adults. LGB individuals face unique stressors, including challenges associated with having a LGB identity. The extent to which these unique stressors are related to dependence motives in LGB adult smokers, however, has not been previously explored. The current study was conducted to redress these gaps. Methods Participants (N = 52; Mage = 42.8; 55.8% Black/African American) were recruited from the local community. Identity facets were measured by the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale (LGBIS). Dependence motives were measured by the Brief Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives. Linear multiple regressions were calculated with the predictors of seven LGBIS subscales for primary and secondary dependence motives, respectively. Results Primary dependence motives (core nicotine dependence features) were predicted by affirmation of LGB identity (β = 0.44). Secondary dependence motives (eg, taste, cognitive/affective enhancement) were predicted by uncertainty of LGB identity (β = 0.43). Conclusions LGB identity affirmation was associated with primary dependence motives, suggesting that a positive view of one’s sexual orientation is a risk factor for dependence. It may be that identity affirmation is related to stronger involvement with the LGB community, which has smoking-friendly norms. Identity uncertainty was associated with secondary dependence motives; this unique identity challenge may represent a stressor contributing to smoking dependence. Findings can help explain the higher rate of smoking in LGB populations and offer avenues to better tailor smoking cessation interventions. Implications The current study is the first to examine multidimensional aspects of LGB identity in explaining smoking dependence motives among LGB adults. Results reveal that LGB identity challenges are associated with dependence motives, suggesting that interventions targeting these challenges may be help reduce LGB smoking disparities. Specifically, reducing identity uncertainty may help reduce smoking dependence. Though identity affirmation was a smoking dependence correlate, it is counterproductive to reduce affirmation, given its association with other positive health outcomes. Rather, interventions to change LGB community norms around smoking appear warranted, given the documented high overlap between affirmation and community affiliation.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntx061,"Smith, Nathan Grant; Winderman, Kate; King, Brooke; Obasi, Ezemenari M; Reitzel, Lorraine R","Department of Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, College of Education, University of Houston, Houston, TX Department of Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, College of Education, University of Houston, Houston, TX Department of Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, College of Education, University of Houston, Houston, TX Department of Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, College of Education, University of Houston, Houston, TX Department of Psychological, Health, and Learning Sciences, College of Education, University of Houston, Houston, TX",,,1,1,

Methods A prospective randomized design was used to evaluate the added benefits of an LGBT culturally targeted Courage to Quit (CTQ-CT) smoking cessation treatment (N = 172) compared with the standard intervention (CTQ; N = 173). The smoking cessation program consisted of six treatment sessions combined with 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy. The primary smoking cessation outcome was 7-day point prevalence quit rates. Secondary outcomes examined included changes in nicotine dependence, nicotine withdrawal, cigarettes per day, smoking urges, self-efficacy, and readiness to quit. Results Overall quit rates were 31.9% at 1 month, 21.1% at 3 months, 25.8% at 6 months, and 22.3% at 12 months. Quit rates did not differ between treatment groups [1 month OR = 0.81 (0.32, 2.09), 3 months OR = 0.65 (0.23, 1.78), 6 months OR = 0.45 (0.17, 1.21), 12 months OR = 0.70 (0.26, 1.91)]. Compared with baseline levels, all secondary smoking cessation outcomes measured were improved at 1 month and were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Compared with the CTQ, the CTQ-CT intervention was more highly rated on program effectiveness (d = 0.2, p = .011), intervention techniques (d = 0.2, p = .014), the treatment manual (d = 0.3, p < .001), and being targeted to the needs of LGBT smokers (d = 0.5, p < .0001). Conclusions LGBT smokers receiving the CTQ intervention achieved smoking cessation outcomes in the range reported for other demographic groups. Cultural targeting improved the acceptability of the intervention but did not confer any additional benefit for smoking cessation outcomes. Implications Study results have implications for understanding the benefits of culturally targeted compared with nontargeted smoking cessation interventions for improving smoking cessation outcomes among LGBT smokers. Shorter and longer term 7-day point prevalence quit rates associated with the targeted and nontargeted interventions were modest but comparable with other group-based interventions delivered in a community setting. Although cultural targeting improved the overall acceptability of the intervention, no added benefits were observed for the culturally targeted intervention on either the primary or secondary outcomes.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/nty184,"Matthews, Alicia K; Steffen, Alana D; Kuhns, Lisa M; Ruiz, Raymond A; Ross, Nat A; Burke, Larisa A; Li, Chien Ching; King, Andrea C","Department of Health Systems Sciences, College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL Department of Health Systems Sciences, College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL Department of Pediatrics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL College of Medicine, Center for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL Department of Research, Howard Brown Health Center, Chicago, IL Department of Health Systems Sciences, College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL Department of Health Services Research, Rush University, Chicago, IL Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Tobacco Advertisement Liking, Vulnerability Factors, and Tobacco Use Among Young Adults",article,"['sex', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction Young adulthood (aged 18–24) is a crucial period in the development of long-term tobacco use patterns. Tobacco advertising and promotion lead to the initiation and continuation of smoking among young adults. We examined whether vulnerability factors moderated the association between tobacco advertisement liking and tobacco use in the United States. Methods Analyses were conducted among 9109 US young adults in the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study wave 1 (2013–14). Participants viewed 20 randomly selected sets of tobacco advertisements (five each for cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco) and indicated whether they liked each ad. The outcome variables were past 30-day cigarette, e-cigarette, cigar, and smokeless tobacco use. Covariates included tobacco advertisement liking, age, sex, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, poverty level, military service, and internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms. Results Liking tobacco advertisements was associated with tobacco use, and this association was particularly strong among those with lower educational attainment (cigarettes, cigars) and living below the poverty level (e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco). Conclusions The association between tobacco advertisement liking and tobacco use was stronger among young adults with lower educational attainment and those living below the poverty level. Policies that restrict advertising exposure and promote counter-marketing messages in this population could reduce their risk. Implications This study shows that liking tobacco advertisements is associated with current tobacco use among young adults, with stronger associations for vulnerable young adults (ie, lower education levels and living below the poverty level).

The tobacco industry has a history targeting LGBT with marketing efforts, likely contributing to this disparity. This study explores whether exposure to tobacco content on traditional and social media is associated with tobacco use among LGBT and non-LGBT. Methods This study reports results from LGBT (N = 1092) and non-LGBT (N = 16430) respondents to a 2013 nationally representative cross-sectional online survey of US adults (N = 17522). Frequency and weighted prevalence were estimated and adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results LGBT reported significantly higher rates of past 30-day tobacco media exposure compared to non-LGBT, this effect was strongest among LGBT who were smokers (p < .05). LGBT more frequently reported exposure to, searching for, or sharing messages related to tobacco couponing, e-cigarettes, and anti-tobacco on new or social media (eg, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) than did non-LGBT (p < .05). Non-LGBT reported more exposure from traditional media sources such as television, most notably anti-tobacco messages (p = .0088). LGBT had higher odds of past 30-day use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cigars compared to non-LGBT, adjusting for past 30-day media exposure and covariates (p ≤ .0001). Conclusions LGBT (particularly LGBT smokers) are more likely to be exposed to and interact with tobacco-related messages on new and social media than their non-LGBT counterparts. Higher levels of tobacco media exposure were significantly associated with higher likelihood of tobacco use. This suggests tobacco control must work toward reaching LGBT across a variety of media platforms, particularly new and social media outlets. Implications This study provides important information about LGBT communities tobacco-related disparities in increased exposure to pro-tobacco messages via social media, where the tobacco industry has moved since the MSA. Further, LGBT when assessed as a single population appear to identify having decreased exposure to anti-tobacco messages via traditional media, where we know a large portion of tobacco control and prevention messages are placed. The study points to the need for targeted and tailored approaches by tobacco control to market to LGBT using on-line resources and tools in order to help reduce LGBT tobacco-related health disparities. Although there have been localized campaigns, only just recently have such LGBT-tailored national campaigns been developed by the CDC, FDA, and Legacy, assessment of the content, effectiveness, and reach of both local and national campaigns will be important next steps.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/nty049,"Emory, Kristen; Buchting, Francisco O; Trinidad, Dennis R; Vera, Lisa; Emery, Sherry L","Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, Health Sciences Dr., La Jolla, CA Graduate School of Public Health, Campanile Drive, San Diego, CA Horizons Foundation, Suite, San Francisco, CA Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, Health Sciences Dr, La Jolla, CA VeraCite, Inc., San Diego, CA NORC at the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL",,,1,1,

Methods We used data from the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions based on in-person interviews with a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized US adults. Approximately 8.3% of the target population was estimated to have same-sex sexual attraction, 3.1% had at least one same-sex sexual partner in the past-year, and 2.8% self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Results Sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual identity were significantly associated with cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 TUD. Risk of all tobacco/nicotine outcomes was most pronounced for bisexual adults across all three sexual orientation dimensions. Approximately half of sexual minorities who identified as lesbian or gay and one-fourth of those who identified as bisexual reported past-year sexual orientation discrimination. Sexual minorities who experienced high levels of past-year sexual orientation discrimination had significantly greater probability of past-year cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and TUD relative to sexual minorities who experienced lower levels of sexual orientation discrimination or no discrimination. Conclusions Sexual minorities, especially bisexual adults, are at heightened risk of cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 TUD across all three major sexual orientation dimensions. Tobacco prevention and cessation efforts should target bisexual adults and consider the role that sexual orientation discrimination plays in cigarette smoking and treatment of TUD. Implications Differences in tobacco/nicotine use by sexual orientation are well documented, but little is known about differences across all three sexual orientation dimensions (attraction, behavior, and identity) or the origins of these differences. This study is the first to show that differences in tobacco/nicotine use across the three sexual orientation dimensions for respondents who were exclusively heterosexually-oriented were minimal, but varied more substantially among sexual minority women and men across the three sexual orientation dimensions. Sexual minorities who experienced high levels of past-year sexual orientation discrimination had significantly greater probability of cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntx283,"McCabe, Sean Esteban; Hughes, Tonda L; Matthews, Alicia K; Lee, Joseph G L; West, Brady T; Boyd, Carol J; Arslanian-Engoren, Cynthia","Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Institute for Research on Women and Gender, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI School of Nursing and Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL Department of Health Education and Promotion, College of Health and Human Performance, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC Institute for Social Research, Survey Research Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Institute for Research on Women and Gender, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Addiction Center, Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Widespread Belief That Organic and Additive-Free Tobacco Products are Less Harmful Than Regular Tobacco Products: Results From the 2017 US Health Information National Trends Survey,article,"['gender', 'sexual orientation']","Significance US smokers of Natural American Spirit, a brand marketed as “organic” and “additive-free,” are more likely than other cigarette smokers to believe that their brand might be less harmful than other brands. This article (1) describes the prevalence of belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco is less harmful than regular tobacco products in the US population and (2) describes the sociodemographic characteristics of adults who believe tobacco products with these descriptors are less harmful. Methods Data were drawn from the 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a nationally representative survey of US adults. Logistic regression models were used to examine correlates of the belief that “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than regular tobacco products. Results Overall, 26.7% of US adults and 45.3% of adult smokers believe that “organic” tobacco products are less harmful than regular tobacco products. Similarly, 35.2% of US adults and 47.1% of smokers believe that “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful. When examining gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and smoking status, only age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ~0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97, 0.99 for both outcomes) and smoking status (current vs. never smokers, aOR ~1.78, 95% CI 1.03, 3.07 for both outcomes) were correlates of believing that “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco is less harmful than regular tobacco products. Conclusions Belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than other products is widespread. Younger adults and current smokers are most likely to be misinformed by “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco product descriptors. Implications Belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than other products is widespread among US adults and most prevalent among smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility and Utilization Among Transgender Patients: An Analysis of the 2017–2018 United States Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey,article,"['cisgender', 'gender', 'gender identity', 'transgender']","Introduction Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons disproportionately face many health disparities including a higher risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer screening (LCS) using low-dose chest computed tomography has reduced lung cancer mortality in eligible high-risk smokers across several large trials, yet utilization of LCS remains low. TGD persons may be less likely to receive recommended cancer screening compared with cisgender populations. We sought to compare eligibility for and utilization of LCS between TGD and cisgender persons in the United States. We also examined if the utilization of LCS varied by smoking status within each gender identity group. Methods We analyzed data from the 2017 and 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) cross-sectional survey to determine eligibility and utilization of LCS among TGD participants compared with cisgender persons. Logistical regression analysis of potentially confounding variables included age category, race/ethnicity, income, employment status, health insurance, and having a personal doctor. Results Of 37 023 weighted respondents, 0.5% were TGD. Although eligibility for LCS was statistically similar (8.8% TGD vs. 12.2% cisgender) (adjusted odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.27–2.39, p = .703), only 2.3% of TGD participants reported obtaining a LCS chest computed tomography versus 17.2% of cisgender participants (adjusted odds ratio = 0.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.01–0.59, p = .019). Smoking status showed no association with LCS utilization among gender identity groups. Conclusions TGD persons may be less likely to receive LCS despite having similar smoking status and eligibility of cisgender persons, suggesting a disparity in utilization of this preventative health service. Implications Targeted efforts to increase LCS utilization and promote smoking cessation for at-risk TGD patients may be warranted.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa127,"Stowell, Justin T; Parikh, Yasha; Tilson, Kimberly; Narayan, Anand K","Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL Department of Radiology, Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, MA Behavioral Health Community Access Program, Truman Medical Centers, Kansas City, MO Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"We are in This Together: Promoting Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Tobacco Research for Sexual and Gender Minority Populations",article,"['cisgender', 'gender', 'gender minority', 'heterosexual', 'sexual and gender minority']","Introduction Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals have higher tobacco use prevalence and consequently higher burden of tobacco-caused diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease compared with their heterosexual or cisgender counterparts. Yet, there is a critical gap in research focused on measuring SGM tobacco-related health disparities and addressing unmet needs of SGM individuals in the context of nicotine and tobacco research. Aims and Methods In this commentary, we summarize recommendations discussed during a pre-conference workshop focused on challenges and opportunities in conducting SGM tobacco control research at the 2019 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Annual Meeting. Results Specifically, we recommend defining and measuring SGM identity in all nicotine and tobacco research routinely, using novel methods to engage a demographically diverse sample of the SGM population, and eliciting SGM community voices in tobacco control research. Conclusions Addressing these critical research gaps will enable the scientific community to generate the data to fully understand and support SGM individuals in tobacco use prevention and cessation. Implications Tobacco use and its consequences have become increasingly concentrated in disadvantaged groups, including sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Through concrete recommendations in this commentary, we aimed to promote health equity, diversity, and inclusion in tobacco research for SGM populations by urging the scientific community to consider expanding efforts to monitor and address tobacco-related health disparities of SGM populations within their respective research programs.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa070,"Dermody, Sarah S; On Behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Health Disparities Network; Heffner, Jaimee L; On Behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Health Disparities Network; Hinds, Josephine T; On Behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Health Disparities Network; McQuoid, Julia; On Behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Health Disparities Network; Quisenberry, Amanda J; On Behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Health Disparities Network; Tan, Andy S L; On Behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Health Disparities Network; Vogel, Erin A; On Behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Health Disparities Network","School of Psychological Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA Department of Kinesiology and Health Education, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA Department of Health Behavior, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY Division of Population Sciences, Center for Community-Based Research, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA Stanford Prevention Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Long-Term Smoking Cessation Outcomes for Sexual Minority Versus Nonminority Smokers in a Large Randomized Controlled Trial of Two Web-Based Interventions,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'sexual minority']","Introduction Despite greater smoking prevalence among sexual minority (SM) individuals relative to non-SM individuals, minimal research has examined whether SM smokers have differential success at quitting, and no prior treatment studies have examined differences within SM subgroups. There is also limited knowledge of the psychosocial characteristics of treatment-seeking SM smokers, which could inform targeted treatments. To address these gaps, we compared treatment outcomes and baseline characteristics for SM and non-SM smokers and for bisexual versus lesbian or gay smokers in a large randomized controlled trial of two web-based cessation treatments. Methods Trial participants completed a survey to assess baseline characteristics, including self-identification as either SM (n = 253; lesbian or gay, n = 122; bisexual, n = 131) or non-SM (n = 2384). The primary cessation outcome was complete-case, self-reported 30-day abstinence at 12 months after randomization. Results Cessation outcomes did not differ significantly for SM versus non-SM smokers (24% vs. 25%, adjusted OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.28) or across SM subgroups (24% for bisexual vs. 23% for lesbian or gay, adjusted OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.51 to 2.00), and there were no interactions with treatment group assignment. At baseline, SM smokers differed from non-SM smokers on most demographics, were more likely to screen positive for all mental health conditions assessed, and had greater exposure to other smokers in the home. Conclusions Substantial differences in baseline characteristics of SM versus non-SM smokers and bisexual versus lesbian or gay smokers did not translate into differential treatment outcomes. Nonetheless, SM smokers’ willingness or ability to quit smoking could be enhanced by taking their unique psychosocial profile into account when designing targeted interventions. Implications The findings of this study, which included the largest sample of SM smokers in a prospective intervention trial to date, support those of a small extant body of literature showing no differences in treatment-assisted cessation outcomes between SM and non-SM smokers. Regardless of their quit rates relative to non-SM smokers, SM smokers’ willingness or ability to quit smoking could potentially be enhanced by taking their unique psychosocial profile into account in intervention design, including their younger age, lower socioeconomic status, greater likelihood of being racial or ethnic minorities, and greater prevalence of mental health symptoms.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz112,"Heffner, Jaimee L; Mull, Kristin E; Watson, Noreen L; McClure, Jennifer B; Bricker, Jonathan B","Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (formerly Group Health Research Institute), Seattle, WA Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Put It Out Project (POP) Facebook Intervention for Young Sexual and Gender Minority Smokers: Outcomes of a Pilot, Randomized, Controlled Trial",article,"['gender', 'gender minority', 'sexual and gender minority']","Introduction This trial investigated whether a Facebook smoking cessation intervention culturally tailored to young sexual and gender minority (SGM) smokers (versus non-tailored) would increase smoking abstinence. Methods Participants were 165 SGM young adult US smokers (age 18–25) recruited from Facebook in April 2018 and randomized to an SGM-tailored (POP; N = 84) or non-tailored (TSP-SGM; N = 81) intervention. Interventions delivered weekly live counseling sessions and 90 daily Facebook posts to participants in Facebook groups. Primary analyses compared POP and TSP-SGM on biochemically verified smoking abstinence (yes/no; primary outcome), self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (yes/no), reduction in cigarettes per week by 50+% from baseline (yes/no), making a quit attempt during treatment (yes/no), and stage of change (precontemplation/contemplation vs. preparation/action). Supplemental analyses compared POP to two historical control groups. Results POP participants were more likely than TSP-SGM participants to report smoking abstinence at 3 (23.8% vs. 12.3%; OR = 2.50; p = .03) and 6 months (34.5% vs. 12.3%; OR = 4.06; p < .001) and reduction in smoking at 3 months (52.4% vs. 39.5%; OR = 2.11; p = .03). Biochemically verified smoking abstinence did not significantly differ between POP and TSP-SGM at 3 (OR = 2.00; p = .33) or 6 months (OR = 3.12; p = .08), potentially due to challenges with remote biochemical verification. In supplemental analyses, POP participants were more likely to report abstinence at 3 (OR = 6.82, p = .01) and 6 (OR = 2.75, p = .03) months and reduced smoking at 3 months (OR = 2.72, p = .01) than participants who received a referral to Smokefree.gov. Conclusions This pilot study provides preliminary support for the effectiveness of a Facebook smoking cessation intervention tailored to SGM young adults. Implications SGM individuals have disproportionately high smoking prevalence. It is unclear whether smoking cessation interventions culturally tailored to the SGM community are more effective than non-tailored interventions. This pilot trial found preliminary evidence that an SGM-tailored Facebook smoking cessation intervention increased reported abstinence from smoking, compared to a non-tailored intervention.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Smoking and Quitting Behavior by Sexual Orientation: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Adults in England,article,"['bisexual', 'bisexuals', 'gay', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'sexual minority', 'sexual orientation']","Objective To assess associations between sexual orientation and smoking and quitting behavior among adults in England. Methods Data were collected from 112 537 adults (≥16 years) participating in a nationally representative monthly cross-sectional survey between July 2013 and February 2019. Sexual orientation was self-reported as heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian/gay, or prefer-not-to-say. Main outcomes were smoking status, e-cigarette use, cigarettes per day, time to first cigarette, motivation to stop smoking, motives for quitting, use of cessation support, and past‐year quit attempts. Associations were analyzed separately for men and women using multivariable regression models adjusted for relevant covariates. Results Smoking prevalence is now similar between gay (21.6%), prefer-not-to-say (20.5%) and heterosexual men (20.0%), and lesbian (18.3%) and heterosexual women (16.9%), but remains higher among bisexual men (28.2%, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.79) and bisexual women (29.8%, ORadj = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.33 to 2.03) and lower among prefer-not-to-say women (14.5%, ORadj = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.72 to 0.99). Among smokers, bisexuals were less addicted than heterosexuals, with bisexual men smoking fewer cigarettes per day (Badj = −2.41, 95% CI = −4.06 to −0.75) and bisexual women less likely to start smoking within 30 min of waking (ORadj = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.95) than heterosexuals. However, motivation to stop smoking and quit attempts did not differ significantly. Conclusions In England, differences in smoking prevalence among people with different sexual orientations have narrowed, primarily driven by a larger decline in smoking rates among sexual minority groups than heterosexuals. Bisexual men and women remain more likely to smoke but have lower levels of addiction while being no less likely to try to quit. Implications This population-based study provides an up-to-date picture of smoking and quitting behavior in relation to sexual orientation among adults in England. Findings suggest that widely documented disparities in smoking prevalence have narrowed over recent years, with gay men and lesbian women no longer significantly more likely to smoke than heterosexuals, although smoking remains more common among bisexual men and women. Insights into differences in level of addiction, use of cessation support, and motives for quitting may help inform the development of targeted interventions to further reduce smoking among sexual minority groups.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa042,"Jackson, Sarah E; Brown, Jamie; Grabovac, Igor; Cheeseman, Hazel; Osborne, Ciaran; Shahab, Lion","Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, London, UK Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, London, UK Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Centre for Public Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Action on Smoking and Health, London, UK Action on Smoking and Health, London, UK Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, London, UK",,,1,1,
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,High-School Students Rarely Use E-Cigarettes Alone: A Sociodemographic Analysis of Polysubstance Use Among Adolescents in the United States,article,"['bisexual', 'straight']","Introduction Most adolescents reporting e-cigarette use have also used combustible tobacco; however, the extent to which they use other substances is less clear. This study assessed e-cigarette use with tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis and quantified the risk of polysubstance use among adolescents overall and by sociodemographic characteristics. Aims and Methods Using 2017 Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from adolescents (grades 9–12) with complete substance use information (n = 11 244), we examined e-cigarette poly-use status (none [referent], e-cigarettes only, or e-cigarettes + other substances). We estimated the prevalence of substance use and modeled odds of e-cigarette use, alone or with other substances, by several sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses were completed in Stata version 15.1 using survey procedures to account for the complex survey design. Results Approximately 12% of adolescents reported past 30-day e-cigarette use. Almost all (93%) e-cigarette users also reported other substance use; alcohol appeared most frequently in combinations. Odds of e-cigarette single use and e-cigarette poly-use (vs. no use) were higher for males and adolescents with lower grades (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.44–2.31). Racial/ethnic minorities had lower odds of e-cigarette poly-use than White peers (ORs = 0.18–0.61), and bisexual (vs. straight) adolescents were more likely to be e-cigarette poly-users (OR = 1.62). E-cigarette use increased from 9th grade (7%) to 12th grade (16%). Conclusions Polysubstance use is highly prevalent among adolescents who use e-cigarettes. Therefore, e-cigarette screening should include the assessment of other substances, especially alcohol. Early and comprehensive prevention efforts to reduce e-cigarette and other substance use could have a substantial beneficial impact on population health over time. Implications This study extends knowledge about e-cigarette use among adolescents by exploring its use with alcohol, cannabis, and other tobacco products. We found that e-cigarettes were very rarely used alone, and our analysis identified several sociodemographic factors associated with greater odds of e-cigarette polysubstance use. In response, we recommend that prevention interventions address multiple substances concurrently, screen repeatedly to detect new initiation as age increases, focus on e-cigarette use as a less stigmatized entry point to discussions of substance use, and target priority population subgroups.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa037,"Gilbert, Paul A; Kava, Christine M; Afifi, Rima","Department of Community and Behavioral Health, University of Iowa College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA Health Promotion Research Center, Department of Health Services, University of Washington, Seattle, WA Department of Community and Behavioral Health, University of Iowa College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA",,,1,1,

While the overall prevalence in cigarette smoking has decreased since the mid-20th century, the proportion of menthol cigarette smokers has increased in recent years2,3. Notably, sociodemographic disparities in menthol cigarette smoking persist in the U.S.3. A higher prevalence of menthol cigarette smoking has been documented among vulnerable groups, including Black/African Americans, women, young adults, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals4,5. Such disparities are due, in part, to the targeted marketing of menthol cigarettes by the tobacco industry6,7. Moreover, menthol cigarettes appeal more to novice smokers, and evidence8-10 indicates that the flavor and cooling sensations of menthol mask the harshness of inhaling cigarette smoke and help to facilitate smoking initiation and nicotine dependence.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.18332/tpc/90968,Sabrina L.
