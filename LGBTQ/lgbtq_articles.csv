Tobacco Control,2015,"What do we know about unassisted smoking cessation in Australia? A systematic review, 2005–2012",Review Article,['questioning'],"Context A significant proportion of smokers who quit do so on their own without formal help (ie, without professionally or pharmacologically mediated assistance), yet research into how smokers quit focuses primarily on assisted methods of cessation. Objective The aim of the present work was to systematically review recent smoking cessation research in Australia, a nation advanced in tobacco control, to determine what is known about smokers who quit unassisted in order to (1) inform a research agenda to develop greater understanding of the many smokers who quit unassisted and (2) elucidate possible lessons for policy and mass communication about cessation. Methods In January 2013, four e-databases and the grey literature were searched for articles published between 2005 and 2012 on smoking cessation in Australia. Articles focusing solely on interventions designed to stimulate cessation were excluded, as were articles focusing solely on assisted cessation, leaving articles reporting on smokers who quit unassisted. Data from articles reporting on unassisted cessation were extracted and grouped into related categories. Results A total of 248 articles reported on smoking cessation, of which 63 focused solely on interventions designed to stimulate cessation, leaving 185 reporting on the method of cessation (‘how’ a smoker quits). Of these, 166 focused solely on assisted cessation, leaving 19 reporting, either directly or indirectly, on smokers who quit unassisted. Data from these studies indicated 54% to 69% of ex-smokers quit unassisted and 41% to 58% of current smokers had attempted to quit unassisted. Conclusions The majority of Australian smokers quit or attempt to quit unassisted, yet little research has been dedicated to understanding this process. Almost all research that reported unassisted cessation referenced it as a comparator to the focal point of assisted cessation. Public health may benefit from insights gained from greater research into the cessation method used by most smokers. Suggestions and a rationale for such research are provided. ","Attitudes and beliefs Why do so many smokers choose not to use assistance in the face of so much persuasion to do so? Why do smokers who quit on their own perceive assisted cessation to be a sign of weakness? Do ex-smokers inflate their own role in their quitting and downplay the role assistance played to their success? What characterises smokers who want to quit on their own: is it that they want to quit without pharmacotherapy or without any form of help at all (including help from GPs, quitline services and stop-smoking clinics)? Have smokers who quit unassisted tried assistance before and realised that motivation and determination are critically important components of quitting? Experiences How do those who quit unassisted find the experience in terms of its degree of difficulty? How does the experience of quitting unassisted compare with a smoker's expectations? Does the experience of quitting unassisted differ for those who are heavily addicted compared with less addicted smokers? Does the current focus on use of medications to quit mislead smokers about how hard or easy it will be to quit? Does marketing for pharmaceutical aids have any impact on smokers’ self-efficacy? Have smokers who successfully quit unassisted previous experience of quitting with assistance? If so, how has this informed they unassisted quit attempt? Processes How do those who successfully quit unassisted actually go about doing so? Is their success linked to deliberate quitting strategies or lifestyle factors (such as exercise, prayer, meditation or diet) that are not used by those who quit with assistance? Do successful unassisted quitters have common ‘meta-narratives’ or heuristics that they believe assisted their determination to quit and to not relapse? Are there exogenous (environmental) or endogenous (psychological) factors that many successful unassisted quitters have found useful? Is to possible to identify which smokers are likely to quit unassisted, and potentially put in place a spectrum of policy interventions for different types of smokers, which can more effectively and more efficiently help them quit earlier? Australia, with its history of vanguard tobacco control policies and fearlessness in questioning established dogmas, was thought to be the ideal place to assess what is currently known about smokers who quit on their own without formal help. Apart from confirming that the majority of Australian smokers do indeed quit on their own without formal help, we found little is known about this significant population and this potentially significant phenomenon. A consequence of the neglect of research into unassisted cessation is the lack of discourse in relation to the potential contribution that unassisted cessation—when promoted alongside existing policy and treatment practices—might make in reducing smoking prevalence at the population level. Given the important role that cessation plays in reducing prevalence, it is essential that we gain a greater understanding about how and why smokers quit on their own without formal help. Lessons learnt from such research are highly likely to be of direct relevance to policy and practice, particularly to informing mass media campaigns that reach all smokers, including those who might prefer to quit unassisted.

Tobacco Control,2015,A novel approach for monitoring tobacco use in local communities by wastewater analysis,Research Article,['trans'],"Objective We propose a novel approach for measuring tobacco use in a community through the chemical analysis of nicotine metabolites in urban wastewater. It offers frequent monitoring and ‘real-time’, ‘evidence-based’ estimates of tobacco consumption which may complement epidemiological surveillance systems normally repeated only every few years. Methods Two urinary metabolites of nicotine, namely cotinine and trans-3′-hydroxycotinine, were selected as biomarkers of tobacco consumption in urban wastewater. During smoking, a known amount of nicotine is absorbed and after metabolism excreted as metabolites in urine, ending up in the wastewater; quantitative analysis of the metabolites in the wastewater allows back-calculation of the nicotine collectively absorbed by the population producing the sewage and, indirectly, their tobacco use. Representative samples of wastewater were collected from sewage treatment plants in eight Italian cities and analysed by mass spectrometry. Mass loads of the metabolites were used to estimate nicotine consumption. Results Wastewater analysis in the cities under study was used to estimate the number of cigarettes smoked, in order to compare the results of this study with those obtained from population surveys. The number of cigarettes calculated with the two methods were closely comparable and wastewater analysis was sufficiently sensitive to confirm the differences in tobacco consumption between northern and southern Italy, previously described in population surveys. Conclusions The described approach can serve as a supplementary indicator of tobacco consumption in local communities. This approach can provide objective and updated information, which are useful to assess the efficacy of tobacco-control interventions, with the aim of designing and implementing effective tobacco control plans. ","This paper describes a novel approach for measuring tobacco use based on wastewater analysis. The approach offers frequent monitoring and ‘real-time’, ‘evidence-based’ estimates of tobacco consumption. The number of cigarettes calculated through population surveys and wastewater analysis were closely comparable.

Tobacco Control,2015,The impact of smoke-free legislation on reducing exposure to secondhand smoke: differences across gender and socioeconomic groups,Research Article,['gender'],"Background On 11 January 2009, Taiwan expanded its smoke-free legislation to all indoor public places and workplaces. This study examined the impact of this policy on secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in adult non-smokers, across gender and socioeconomic status groups (SES). Methods An annual sample of about 13 000–14 000 non-smokers was drawn from cross-sectional nationwide data of Taiwan Adult Tobacco Behavior Surveys during 2005–2011. Logistic regressions were used to analyse the aggregate data to estimate the association between the 2009 smoke-free legislation and SHS exposures in homes and workplaces. Interaction terms were used to examine the impact of the 2009 smoke-free policy on reducing differences in SHS exposure across gender, education and income groups. Results The 2009 policy reduced the odds of SHS exposure in homes in 2009 (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.84) and in workplaces (year 2009: OR=0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.62; year 2010: OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95). The model with interaction terms showed that men were more likely than women to be exposed to workplace SHS (OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.27) but were less likely to be exposed to home SHS (OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.86). SHS exposure in homes was significantly related to lower socioeconomic status, but the 2009 smoke-free policy reduced the difference in SHS exposure across education levels. Conclusions The 2009 smoke-free policy reduced the SHS exposure for non-smokers. However, this impact on home SHS did not persist after 2009, and the effect of protection was unequal across gender and SES groups. Thus, further enforcement of smoking restrictions would be needed to reduce the risk of SHS exposure and improve protection against SHS risk among parts of the population with lower socioeconomic status. ",This is a 3-year evaluation of reduction in secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among non-smokers in workplaces and homes as a result of the enforcement of a national smoke-free law in year 2009. We examined the relationship between SHS exposure and socioeconomic status. We found a strong inverse association between education level and SHS exposure. Our study demonstrated the effect of smoke-free laws on reducing the differences in SHS exposure across education levels. ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051004,Yi-Wen Tsai; Li-Chuan Chang; Hai-Yen Sung; Teh-wei Hu; Shu-Ti Chiou; ,"Institute of Health and Welfare Policy, National Yang-Ming University; Institute of Health and Welfare Policy, National Yang-Ming University; Institute for Health & Aging, University of California; School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA; Institution of Public Health & Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China; Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, Taiwan, Republic of China; "
Tobacco Control,2015,What will it take to get to under 5% smoking prevalence by 2025? Modelling in a country with a smokefree goal,Research Article,['sex'],"Background New Zealand has a goal of becoming a smokefree nation by the year 2025. Smoking prevalence in 2012 was 17%, but is over 40% for Māori (indigenous New Zealanders). We forecast the prevalence in 2025 under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, and determined what the initiation and cessation rates would have to be to achieve a <5% prevalence. Methods A dynamic model was developed using Census and Health Survey data from 1981 to 2012 to calculate changes in initiation by age 20 years, and net annual cessation rates, by sex, age, ethnic group and time period. Similar parameters were also calculated from a panel study for sensitivity analyses. ‘Forecasts’ used these parameters, and other scenarios, applied to the 2011–2012 prevalence. Findings Since 2002–2003, prevalence at age 20 years has decreased annually by 3.1% (95% uncertainty interval 0.8% to 5.7%) and 1.1% (−1.2% to 3.2%) for non-Māori males and females, and by 4.7% (2.2% to 7.1%) and 0.0% (−2.2% to 1.8%) for Māori, respectively. Annual net cessation rates from the dynamic model ranged from −3.0% to 6.1% across demographic groups, and from 3.0% to 6.0% in the panel study. Under BAU, smoking prevalence is forecast to be 11% and 9% for non-Māori males and females by 2025, and 30% and 37% for Māori, respectively. Achieving <5% by 2025 requires net cessation rates to increase to 10% for non-Māori and 20% for Māori, accompanied by halving or quartering of initiation rates. Conclusions The smokefree goal of <5% prevalence is only feasible with large increases in cessation rates. ","Previous modelling has forecast future prevalence for various countries under business as usual. This paper models what it would take in the way of initiation rates and cessation rates to achieve a 5% prevalence by 2025—the New Zealand Government's tobacco-free goal. Increased cessation rates are essential to achieving a <5% prevalence. For European/Other people, annual cessation rates need to be about 10%—double to quadruple what they currently are. For Māori, cessation rates need to increase hugely to 20% per annum of smokers stopping. Increasing the rate of fall in initiation helps, but is not as critical as increasing cessation. Intensified business as usual tobacco control seems unlikely to be sufficient to achieve the 2025 goal. Hence supplementary interventions are needed, especially to increase cessation rates in targeted population groups with high smoking rates.

Tobacco Control,2015,Evaluation of a community-based smoking cessation programme for people with severe mental illness,Research Article,['gender'],"Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a smoking cessation programme for smokers living with mental illness, provided within community mental health services, and determine factors which impact on the rates of cessation. Methods One hundred and twenty-nine smoking cessation group programmes were provided within community mental health services in South Australia between 2006 and 2011. Participants’ smoking cessation rates were analysed in terms of demographic factors, smoking history, diagnosis and group participation. Participants completed written questionnaires at registration, at the end of each programme and at 12 months. They were also asked to complete the Fagerström rating scale and use the Micro+Smokerlyzer to measure breath carbon monoxide levels. Results Eight hundred and forty-four smokers living with mental illness registered for the programme. Many continued to be involved in addressing their tobacco use over more than one programme. At the end of their last programme, 581 completed an evaluation and 129 (22.2%) were not smoking. If it is assumed that all who did not complete an evaluation had continued smoking, then the cessation rate was 15.3%. Cessation rates were higher for those who attended more sessions, had decided at registration that they wanted to quit or had a lower level of nicotine dependence. Cessation rates were not significantly affected by gender, diagnosis or the number of years of smoking. Conclusions People with mental illness are concerned about their tobacco use and will seek help if this is available. Smoking cessation programmes which are tailored for this group of smokers can be effective and should be provided by mental health and tobacco control services. ",This paper adds to the small body of literature on behavioural programs to help people living with severe mental illness quit smoking. It provides evidence that smokers with mental illness are concerned about their tobacco use and will seek help if it is available. It has shown that smokers with severe mental illness can quit tobacco if they receive appropriate support. This study provides a framework for mental health and tobacco control workers who are interested in helping smokers with mental illness to address their tobacco use. ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051179,Maxie Ashton; Ashlee Rigby; Cherrie Galletly; ,"Adelaide Mental Health Directorate Adelaide; Mental Health Services (SA), The Adelaide Clinic; Mental Health Services (SA), The Adelaide Clinic; School of Medicine, The University of Adelaide; Northern Adelaide Local Health Network; "
Tobacco Control,2015,Disadvantaged youth and smoking in mature tobacco control contexts: a systematic review and synthesis of qualitative research,Review Article,"['gay', 'glbt']","Objective To review qualitative research and synthesise findings about socioeconomically disadvantaged and socially marginalised adolescents and young adults in mature tobacco control contexts. Data sources Searches of PubMed and MEDLINE, additional purposive searches in Google Scholar, PsycINFO, grey literature, specialist journals and reference lists for English language articles published after 2000. Search terms were qualitative, youth or adolescent or young adult, smoking/tobacco and vulnerable populations or disadvantage or socioeconomic inequality. The most recent update of the search was undertaken in January 2014. Study selection Twenty articles, reporting on 17 studies, from 902 initial records were included. Inclusion criteria were: qualitative study undertaken in a country in the final stage of the tobacco epidemic and with comprehensive tobacco control measures in place, participants were youth who were socioeconomically disadvantaged or members of an identified subgroup with higher smoking prevalence and/or resided in a geographical area of low socioeconomic status. The target age range was 10–24. Data extraction Data were independently extracted by one author, summarised and reviewed, compared and re-reviewed at multiple time points. Data synthesis The majority of studies were from the UK, with the remainder from the USA, Australia and New Zealand. The review used a thematic analysis approach, and started with an open question: ‘what does qualitative research tell us about disadvantaged young people and smoking?’ The synthesis provides insights into the social context of smoking for marginalised and disadvantaged young people, group affiliation and identity, the role of smoking in social capital and sources of cigarettes. Conclusions Surprisingly few qualitative studies focused exclusively on smoking and disadvantaged young people were found. Future qualitative studies on the intersection between specific psychosocial characteristics associated with disadvantage and increased smoking risk would be of use to inform approaches to reduce socioeconomic differentials in smoking prevalence.

What purpose does smoking serve for young people at risk of self-harm? Which contextual factors are the most important in determining smoking trajectories of disadvantaged young people? What are the factors that promote not smoking among young people with cumulative and severe disadvantage? Disadvantaged and socially marginalised young people in countries with advanced tobacco control have significantly higher smoking prevalence than other young people. Qualitative research is important for explaining the processes by which risk factors and contextual differences create these disparities, and to provide insights for effective policies and interventions. This is the first systematic review of qualitative research focused on disadvantaged and marginalised young people and smoking.

Tobacco Control,2015,Greater reductions in nicotine exposure while smoking very low nicotine content cigarettes predict smoking cessation,Research Article,['gender'],"Objective Reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes is a potential regulatory strategy that may enable cessation. The present study investigated the effect of nicotine exposure while smoking very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes on cessation outcomes. The roles of possible sources of nicotine were also explored, including the VLNC cigarette and co-use of cigarettes with normal nicotine content. Methods A secondary data analysis of two analogous randomised trials of treatment seeking, adult daily smokers (n=112) who were instructed to smoke VLNC cigarettes for 6 weeks and then make a quit attempt. Controlling for baseline demographic and smoking features, the association between reductions in nicotine exposure during the 6-week trial, assessed by urinary total cotinine and biomarker-confirmed smoking abstinence 1 month later, was tested. Subsequent analyses controlled for the effects of the frequency of VLNC and normal nicotine content cigarette use and the nicotine yield of the VLNC cigarette (0.05 vs 0.09 mg). Results Greater reductions in nicotine exposure while smoking VLNC cigarettes predicted abstinence independent of individual differences in baseline smoking, cotinine, dependence, gender and study. Nicotine reduction was largest among individuals who were assigned to smoke a VLNC cigarette with lower nicotine yield and who smoked fewer normal nicotine content and VLNC cigarettes. Conclusions In the context of nicotine regulations and corresponding research, factors that undermine nicotine reduction must be addressed, including the availability and use of cigarettes with normal nicotine content and not sufficiently reducing the nicotine yield of cigarettes. Maximising nicotine reduction may facilitate smoking cessation. Trial registration numbers NCT 101050569 and NCT 00777569. ","This is the first study to demonstrate that, when smoking very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, lower levels of nicotine exposure prior to a quit attempt enables cessation. Smoking high nicotine content cigarettes alongside VLNC cigarettes appeared to undermine nicotine reduction efforts and, in turn, reduce quit rates. Thus, the widespread availability of high nicotine content cigarettes may lead researchers to underestimate the public health impact of a nicotine reduction strategy due to non-compliance. Relatively small differences in the nicotine yield of VLNC cigarettes (0.05 vs 0.09 mg yield) appeared to impact cessation rates.

Tobacco Control,2015,The effect of MPOWER on smoking prevalence,Research Article,['sex'],"Objective To examine the effect of varying levels of comprehensive tobacco control on smoking in a global context. Methods Using data from WHO's Reports on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, scatter plots were produced to visualise the relationship between comprehensive tobacco control policy (2008 MPOWER composite score) and change in current tobacco smoking between 2006 and 2009. Fixed-effect regression models assessed the effect of changes in each MPOWER measure on changes in current tobacco smoking between 2006 and 2009. All analyses were stratified by sex. Results Overall, countries with higher MPOWER composite scores experienced greater decreases in current tobacco smoking between the years 2006 and 2009. Regression analyses revealed that the M and R measures showed a negative association with current tobacco smoking over time. Current tobacco smoking decreased (1.07 percentage points for males, 1.04 percentage points for females) with each increase in score value for monitoring tobacco use (M). Also, current tobacco smoking decreased (0.95 percentage points for males, 0.41 percentage points for females) with each increase in score value for raising taxes on tobacco (R). The effect of the MPOWER measures on current tobacco smoking varied by country income status (P measure in the female analysis; p<0.05) and/or by WHO region (M, P and O measures in the male analysis; p<0.05). Conclusions Higher levels of MPOWER combined, as well as continued and frequent monitoring of tobacco use (M) and increasing taxation (R), were associated with a decrease in current tobacco smoking over time. ","Single country analyses of the effects of comprehensive tobacco control indicate varying levels of effectiveness. To date, no empirical studies have been published that compare varying levels of MPOWER effects on smoking behaviour across countries. This analysis demonstrates that while the MPOWER package generally works to decrease smoking prevalence, there is a need to explore additional factors that contribute to either promoting or preventing successful reduction.

Tobacco Control,2015,Sex-stratified and age-adjusted social gradients in tobacco in Argentina and Uruguay: evidence from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS),Research Article,['sex'],"Objective To examine social gradients in tobacco use in Argentina and Uruguay, using newly available directly comparable data sets. Methods Secondary analysis of Global Adult Tobacco Survey data from Argentina (N=6645) and Uruguay (N=5581). Social gradients in current tobacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke, and cessation attempt were examined with sex-stratified and age-adjusted logistic regression. Results Among men, there is evidence of higher odds of being a current smoker among respondents with lower levels of education, but the association is only statistically significant for respondents with less than primary education in Uruguay (OR=2.15, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.77). Similarly, women with lower levels of education have higher odds of being a current smoker in Uruguay. The association between education and exposure to secondhand smoke is broadly similar for both sexes in both countries, with generally higher odds among groups with low education, though the relationship is only statistically significant among men in Uruguay (OR=1.77, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.92). In both countries, respondents with lower levels of education in general have higher odds of having attempted to quit smoking in the past year, although these associations did not attain statistical significance. Conclusions Social gradients in tobacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke and cessation attempts are broadly similar in both countries. Efforts to evaluate the long-term effects of tobacco control efforts in these countries should monitor how policies affect national averages, and the social gradients that are embedded in aggregate data. ","This research study is the first of this type to compare social gradients in two Latin American countries using new data from Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS). These countries have different records on tobacco control policy but, at present, relatively similar patterns of socioeconomic inequality in tobacco outcomes. Efforts to evaluate the long-term effects of tobacco control efforts in these countries should monitor how policies affect not only national averages, but also the social gradients that are embedded in aggregate data.

Tobacco Control,2015,"Responses to antismoking radio and television advertisements among adult smokers and non-smokers across Africa: message-testing results from Senegal, Nigeria and Kenya",Research Article,['gender'],"Background This study examined whether adaptation of existing antitobacco television and radio advertisements (ads) from high-income countries is a viable tobacco control strategy for Africa. Methods 1078 male and female adult smokers and non-smokers, aged 18–40 years, from major and smaller urban locations in Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal, were recruited into groups using locally appropriate convenience sampling methods and stratified by smoking status, gender, age and socioeconomic status. Eligibility criteria included age, smoking status and literacy. Each participant rated five radio and five TV antismoking ads on five-point scales, which were later aggregated into measures of perceived effectiveness, potential behaviour change and antitobacco industry sentiment/support for government actions. Results For radio ads across all three countries, two health harms-focused ads—Coughing Child followed by Suffering—had the highest odds of a positive rating on the Perceived Effectiveness measure among smokers and non-smokers. For television ads, the strong graphic ad Baby Alive tended to be rated most positively across the majority of measures by all subgroups. Conclusions This first systematic study of tobacco control advertisements in Africa is consistent with findings from other countries, suggesting that graphic health-harms ads developed and used in other countries could also be effective in African countries. This implies that adaptation would be a successful approach in Africa, where scarce resources for tobacco control communications can be focused on advertising dissemination, saving programmes from the cost, time and technical expertise required for development of new materials. ","In a systematic quantitative study of 10 antitobacco advertisements in three diverse African countries, it was found that health-harm messages developed by and used in other countries would likely also be effective in African contexts. The message features of tobacco control television and radio advertisements with high potential for effectiveness were broadly similar. Being able to adapt existing effective tobacco control advertisements allows programme managers working in African settings to channel limited resources from advertising production into campaign implementation.

Tobacco Control,2015,Protecting the autonomy of states to enact tobacco control measures under trade and investment agreements,Research Article,['trans'],"Since the adoption of the WHO's WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, governments have been pursuing progressively stronger and more wide-reaching tobacco control measures. In response, tobacco companies are frequently using international trade and investment agreements as tools to challenge domestic tobacco control measures. Several significant new trade and investment agreements that some fear may provide new legal avenues to the tobacco industry to challenge health measures are currently under negotiation, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a 12 party agreement of Asia-Pacific regional countries) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (an agreement between the USA and the European Union). This commentary examines different options for treaty provisions that the parties could employ in these agreements to minimise legal risks relating to tobacco control measures. It recommends that parties take a comprehensive approach, combining provisions that minimise the potential costs of litigation with provisions that increase the likelihood of a state successfully defending tobacco control measures in such litigation. ","As the tobacco industry is clearly prepared to use trade and investment agreements to challenge domestic tobacco control measures, when new agreements are negotiated states need to ensure that they include clauses to protect their autonomy to regulate tobacco use. This paper provides an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various options for provisions that could be included in agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership to protect the autonomy of states to adopt tobacco control measures and, for some options, public health policies generally. It may assist states and advocacy groups in seeking a comprehensive, effective approach that will minimise the risk and costs of litigation, as well as limiting the scope of trade and investment obligations, improving the chances that the state will be able to successfully defend its tobacco control measures.

Tobacco Control,2015,Australian adult smokers’ responses to plain packaging with larger graphic health warnings 1 year after implementation: results from a national cross-sectional tracking survey,Research Article,['sex'],"Background We assessed whether the Australian plain packs with larger graphic health warnings (GHWs) achieved three specific objectives of reducing the appeal of tobacco, increasing health warning effectiveness and reducing the ability of packaging to mislead about smoking harms. Methods We compared responses from continuous cross-sectional telephone surveys of n=2176 cigarette smokers during pre-plain packaging (April–September 2012, pre-PP) with n=759 surveyed in the transition period (October–November 2012) and n=4240 during the first year of implementation (December 2012–November 2013, PP year 1), using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results From pre-PP to PP year 1, more smokers disliked their pack (p<0.001), perceived lower pack appeal (p<0.001), lower cigarette quality (p<0.001), lower satisfaction (p<0.001) and lower value (p<0.001) and disagreed brands differed in prestige (p=0.003). There was no change in perceived differences in taste of different brands. More smokers noticed GHWs (p<0.001), attributed much motivation to quit to GHWs (p<0.001), avoided specific GHWs when purchasing (p<0.001), and covered packs (p<0.001), with no change in perceived exaggeration of harms. PP year 1 saw an increased proportion believing that brands do not differ in harmfulness (p=0.004), but no change in the belief that variants do not differ in strength or the perceived harmfulness of cigarettes compared with a year ago. Interactions signified greater change for four outcomes assessing aspects of appeal among young adults and two appeal outcomes among mid-aged adults. Conclusions The specific objectives of plain packaging were achieved and generally sustained among adult smokers up to 12 months after implementation. ","Compared with a pre-plain packaging period, the first year of Australian implementation of plain packaging with larger graphic health warnings saw reduced appeal and increased health warning effectiveness, and some improvement in correcting misperceptions of harms in a national sample of adult cigarette smokers. There was greater change for four appeal-related outcomes for young (18–29 years) adults and two appeal-related outcomes for mid-aged (30–49 years) adults, with no differences by age, sex or socioeconomic status for other outcomes. The specific objectives of plain packaging have been achieved among adult smokers and were generally sustained up to 12 months after implementation.

Tobacco Control,2015,Weight control belief and its impact on the effectiveness of tobacco control policies on quit attempts: findings from the ITC 4 Country Survey,Research Article,['gender'],"Background Weight concerns are widely documented as one of the major barriers for girls and young adult women to quit smoking. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether smokers who have weight concerns respond to tobacco control policies differently than smokers who do not in terms of quit attempts, and how this difference varies by gender and country. Objective This study aims to investigate, by gender and country, whether smokers who believe that smoking helps control weight are less responsive to tobacco control policies with regards to quit attempts than those who do not. Methods We use longitudinal data from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project in the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia to conduct the analysis. We first constructed a dichotomous indicator for smokers who have the weight control belief and then examined the disparity in policy responsiveness in terms of quit attempts by directly estimating the interaction terms of policies and the weight control belief indicator using generalised estimating equations. Findings We find that weight control belief significantly attenuates the policy impact of tobacco control measures on quit attempts among US female smokers and among UK smokers. This pattern was not found among smokers in Canada and Australia. Conclusions Although our results vary by gender and country, the findings suggest that weight concerns do alter policy responsiveness in quit attempts in certain populations. Policy makers should take this into account and alleviate weight concerns to enhance the effectiveness of existing tobacco control policies on promoting quitting smoking. ","This paper provides the first analysis on whether weight concerns alter smokers’ responsiveness to tobacco control policies in making a quit attempt. Among US female smokers and UK smokers, weight concerns do moderate smokers’ responsiveness to tobacco control policies to discourage quit attempts and keep them continuing to smoke.

Tobacco Control,2016,Secondhand smoke exposure and serum cotinine levels among current smokers in the USA,Research Article,['gender'],"Background Secondhand smoke (SHS) likely provides additional exposure to nicotine and toxins for smokers, but has been understudied. Our objective was to determine whether SHS exposure among smokers yields detectable differences in cotinine levels compared with unexposed smokers at the population level. Methods Using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 1999–2012, we compared serum cotinine levels of 4547 current adult cigarette smokers stratified by self-reported SHS exposure sources (home and/or work) and smoking intensity. A weighted multivariable linear regression model determined the association between SHS exposure and cotinine levels among smokers. Results Smokers with SHS exposure at home (43.8%) had higher cotinine levels (β=0.483, p≤0.001) compared with those with no SHS exposure at home after controlling for the number of cigarettes smoked per day and number of days smoked in the previous 5 days, survey year, age, gender and education. Smokers with SHS exposure at work (20.0%) did not have significantly higher cotinine levels after adjustment. The adjusted geometric mean cotinine levels of light smokers (1–9 cigarettes per day) with no SHS exposure, exposure at work only, home only, and both home and work were 52.0, 62.7, 67.2, 74.4 ng/mL, respectively, compared with 219.4, 220.9, 255.2, 250.5 ng/mL among moderate/heavy smokers (≥10 cigarettes per day). Conclusions Smokers living in residences where others smoke inside the home had significantly higher cotinine levels than smokers reporting no SHS exposure, regardless of individual smoking intensity. Future research should target the role that SHS exposure may have in nicotine dependence, cessation outcomes and other health impacts among smokers. ","While there is no safe level of cigarette smoke exposure, little attention has been given to the additional exposure that smokers receive from secondhand smoke. In a nationally representative US sample of over 4500 adult smokers, we detected higher cotinine levels among those exposed to secondhand smoke at home compared with smokers not exposed at home, independent of smoking intensity and other factors. Our findings add biological evidence that secondhand smoke exposure increases tobacco smoke exposure and nicotine uptake, as measured by cotinine levels, even among moderate/heavy smokers. Implications for tobacco control policy (eg, smoke-free homes among smokers and health education on secondhand smoke among smokers), nicotine dependence and smoking cessation treatment are further discussed in the paper.

Tobacco Control,2016,Gender equality and smoking: a theory-driven approach to smoking gender differences in Spain,Research Article,"['female-to-male', 'gender']","Background The intersection between gender and class can aid in understanding gender differences in smoking. Aim To analyse how changes in gender inequality relate to differences in smoking prevalence by gender, education and birth cohort in Spain over the past five decades (1960–2010). Methods The Gender Inequality Index (GII) was calculated in 5-year intervals from 1960 to 2010. GII ranges from 0 to 1 (1=highest inequality) and encompasses three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and labour market. Estimates of female and male smoking prevalence were reconstructed from representative National Health Surveys and stratified by birth cohort and level of education. We calculated female-to-male smoking ratios from 1960 to 2010 stratified by education and birth cohort. Results Gender inequality in Spain decreased from 0.65 to 0.09 over the past 50 years. This rapid decline was inversely correlated (r=−0.99) to a rising female-to-male smoking ratio. The youngest birth cohort of the study (born 1980–1990) and women with high education levels had similar smoking prevalences compared with men. Women with high levels of education were also the first to show a reduction in smoking prevalence, compared with less educated women. Conclusions Gender inequality fell significantly in Spain over the past 50 years. This process was accompanied by converging trends in smoking prevalence for men and women. Smoking prevalence patterns varied greatly by birth cohort and education levels. Countries in earlier stages of the tobacco epidemic should consider gender-sensitive tobacco control measures and policies. ",Smoking prevalence in Spain has tended to converge by gender over time. This social phenomenon has been strongly modified by birth cohort and educational level. Tobacco control policies in countries at earlier stages of the tobacco epidemic should aim to protect younger women with lower educational levels. ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051892,Usama Bilal; Paula Beltrán; Esteve Fernández; Ana Navas-Acien; Francisco Bolumar; Manuel Franco; ,"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; School of Medicine; University of Alcalá; School of Medicine; University of Alcalá; Hospital Universitario La Paz; Cancer Prevention Program.

Tobacco Control,2016,The association of point-of-sale cigarette marketing with cravings to smoke: results from a cross-sectional population-based study,Research Article,['gender'],"Objective To examine the association between recalled exposure to point-of-sale (POS) cigarette marketing (ie, pack displays, advertisements and promotions such as discounts) and reported cravings to smoke while visiting a store. Methods Data were collected using a telephone survey of a cross-sectional sample of 999 adult smokers in Omaha, Nebraska. Recalled exposure to POS cigarette marketing was measured by asking respondents about noticing (a) pack displays, (b) advertisements and (c) promotions in store in their neighbourhood. A 3-item scale indicating the frequency of experiencing cravings to smoke in locations where cigarettes are sold was created by asking respondents: (1) “feel a craving for a cigarette?” (2) “feel like nothing would be better than smoking a cigarette?” and (3) “feel like all you want is a cigarette?” The association between recalled exposure to POS cigarette marketing and cravings was estimated using ordinary least squares linear regression models, controlling for nicotine dependence, gender, age, race/ethnicity, income, education, frequency of visiting stores in one's neighbourhood and method of recruitment into the study. Results Recalled exposure to POS cigarette displays (p<0.001) and advertisements (p=0.002), but not promotions (p=0.06), was associated with more frequent cravings to smoke. Conclusions Recalled exposure to POS cigarette marketing is associated with cravings to smoke as predicted by laboratory studies on the effects of smoking cues on cigarette craving. Policies that reduce or eliminate POS cigarette marketing could reduce cigarette cravings and might attenuate impulse buying of cigarettes. ","Previous studies suggest that exposure to point-of-sale (POS) tobacco marketing may stimulate cravings to smoke. These studies have two shortcomings. First, they only examine one type of cigarette POS marketing, namely cigarette pack displays. The effect of cigarette advertisements and promotions has never been addressed. Second, except a small qualitative study, there are no observational studies about POS cigarette marketing and cravings to smoke. To address these shortcomings, our aim was to assess the association of cravings to smoke with recalled exposure to POS cigarette pack displays, advertisements and promotions using a cross-sectional population-based sample of current smokers in Omaha, Nebraska USA. We found that POS displays and advertisements, but not promotions, have an association with cravings to smoke.

Tobacco Control,2016,Attitudes to smoke-free outdoor regulations in the USA and Canada: a review of 89 surveys,Review Article,['gender'],"Objective To review the published survey data on public support for smoke-free outdoor regulations in the USA and Canada (two countries at the forefront of such policies). Data sources and study selection We searched for English language articles and reports using Medline, Google Scholar and Google for the period to December 2014. We retained population-based surveys of the adult general population in jurisdictions in the USA and Canada, with a minimum survey sample of 500. Data extraction The analysis focused on assessing levels and trends in public support for different types of places and also explored how support varied between population groups. Results Relevant data were found from 89 cross-sectional surveys between 1993 and 2014. Support for smoke-free regulations in outdoor places tended to be highest for smoke-free school grounds (range: 57–95%) playgrounds (89–91%), and building entrances (45–89%) and lowest for smoke-free outdoor workplaces (12–46%) and sidewalks (31–49%). Support was lower among smokers, though for some types of places there was majority smoker support (eg, school grounds with at least 77% support in US state surveys after 2004). Trend data involving the same questions and the same surveyed populations suggested increased general public and smoker support for smoke-free regulations over time (eg, from 67% to 78% during 2002–2008 for smoke-free school grounds in the USA). Higher support was typically seen from women and some ethnic groups (eg, African-Americans). Conclusions Outdoor smoke-free regulations can achieve majority public support, including from smokers. ","A 2008 review of attitudes about outdoor smoke-free policies found 10 surveys from the USA and Canada. In a review of publications to 2014, we found 89 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1993 and 2014 for USA and Canada. Public support for smoke-free regulations for outdoor places tended to be highest for smoke-free school grounds, playgrounds and building entrances, and lowest for smoke-free outdoor workplaces and sidewalks. We found new evidence of patterns of support by geography, gender, ethnicity, age, education and income.

Tobacco Control,2016,The impact of cigarette smoking on life expectancy between 1980 and 2010: a global perspective,Research Article,['sex'],"Introduction Tobacco smoking is among the leading causes of preventable mortality worldwide. We assessed the impact of smoking on life expectancy worldwide between 1980 and 2010. Methods We retrieved cause-specific mortality data from the WHO Mortality Database by sex, year and age for 63 countries with high or moderate quality data (1980–2010). Using the time of the peak of the smoking epidemic by country, relative risks from the three waves of the Cancer Prevention Study were applied to calculate the smoking impact ratio and population attributable fraction. Finally, we estimated the potential gain in life expectancy at age 40 if smoking-related deaths in middle age (40–79 years) were eliminated. Results Currently, tobacco smoking is related to approximately 20% of total adult mortality in the countries in this study (24% in men and 12% in women). If smoking-related deaths were eliminated, adult life expectancy would increase on average by 2.4 years in men (0.1 in Uzbekistan to 4.8 years in Hungary) and 1 year in women (0.1 in Kyrgyzstan to 2.9 years in the USA). The proportion of smoking-related mortality among men has declined in most countries, but has increased in the most populous country in the world, that is, China from 4.6% to 7.3%. Increases in the impact of tobacco on life expectancy were observed among women in high-income countries. Conclusions Recent trends indicate a substantial rise in the population-level impact of tobacco smoking on life expectancy in women and in middle-income countries. High-quality local data are needed in most low-income countries. ","We propose a modification to the original method developed by Peto and colleagues that adjusts the reference population to the country's position within the smoking epidemic. This has enabled the estimation of time trends for 63 countries on the effect of tobacco smoking on total mortality and life expectancy, where 26 countries are from low-income and middle-income settings. Overall, we estimate that if the current tobacco-related deaths were eliminated, life expectancy would increase by 2.4 years for men and 1 year for women, on average.

Tobacco Control,2016,Smokers in Brazil: who are they?,Research Article,['gender'],"Background Brazil has experienced a large decline in smoking prevalence due to several tobacco control policies that were implemented in the past 25 years. Previous population-wide studies found a consistent reduction over time in daily cigarette consumption among all socioeconomic groups. Objective To examine changes between 2008 and 2013 in tobacco behaviours and health-related conditions of smokers. Methods We used data obtained from two nationally-representative surveys conducted in 2008 and 2013 to estimate the prevalence of self-reported psychological and physical morbidity, and nicotine dependence markers, stratified by gender and sociodemographic groups. Generalised linear models were used to understand whether absolute differences in prevalence rates over time differed by categories of selected variables. Results For both genders, as smoking prevalence declined in Brazil, there has been an increase in the proportion of ever smokers who have quit. In addition, remaining smokers seem to be making more quitting attempts. Among men with low educational level or younger than 25 years-old, as compared to their counterparts, cessation rate showed an even greater increase over time. Moreover, the proportion of light smokers, which represent the vast majority of smokers, did not decrease. The percentage of poor health-conditions among remaining smokers nevertheless increased, particularly among women, which can make future cessation more challenging. Conclusions In Brazil, quitting rate is increasing, thus suggesting that tobacco control interventions implemented in Brazil in the past years seem to be effectively reaching the smoking population. This is strong evidence against the ‘hardening hypothesis’, which posits that remaining smokers decrease their willingness and ability to quit. ","It has been argued that remaining smokers are less willing and less likely to quit now than in the past. Previous population-wide studies conducted in Brazil have found a consistent reduction over time in daily cigarette consumption among all socioeconomic groups. Our study expands this assessment to other tobacco behaviours and health-related conditions, and represents the first-ever detailed evaluation of the Brazilian remaining smoking population. In Brazil, for males and females, smoking prevalence rates declined, cessation rates increased, and remaining smokers seem to be making more quitting attempts. These findings suggest that the broad set of legislative, healthcare, education and economic interventions implemented in the past years seem to be effectively reaching the smoking population. Our findings are strong evidence against the ‘hardening hypothesis’ which posits that, as smoking prevalence decreases, the smokers that remain will find quitting more challenging.

Tobacco Control,2016,Thirdhand smoke contamination in hospital settings: assessing exposure risk for vulnerable paediatric patients,Research Article,['trans'],"Background Tobacco has regained the status of the world's number two killer behind heart/vascular disease. Thirdhand smoke (THS) residue and particles from secondhand smoke (SHS) are suspected health hazards (eg, DNA damage) that are likely to contribute to morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable children. THS is easily transported and deposited indoors, where it persists and exposes individuals for months, creating potential health consequences in seemingly nicotine-free environments, particularly for vulnerable patients. We collected THS data to estimate infant exposure in the neonatal ICU (NICU) after visits from household smokers. Infant exposure to nicotine, potentially from THS, was assessed via assays of infant urine. Methods Participants were mothers who smoked and had an infant in the NICU (N=5). Participants provided surface nicotine samples from their fingers, infants’ crib/incubator and hospital-provided furniture. Infant urine was analysed for cotinine, cotinine's major metabolite: trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), a metabolite of the nicotine-derived and tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). Results Incubators/cribs and other furniture had detectable surface nicotine. Detectable levels of cotinine, 3HC and NNAL were found in the infants’ urine. Discussion THS appears to be ubiquitous, even in closely guarded healthcare settings. Future research will address potential health consequences and THS-reduction policies. Ultimately, hospital policies and interventions to reduce THS transport and exposure may prove necessary, especially for immunocompromised children. ","Thirdhand smoke (THS) contamination is unexplored in non-smoking, protected medical environments visited by smokers. THS is estimated to take weeks to months to degrade in controlled environments. Infants cared for during extended stays in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are protected from secondhand smoke, but exposure to THS is unknown. This study demonstrated that THS is deposited in rooms of NICU infants visited by smokers. Data showed that NICU infants are exposed to nicotine and nicotine-derived, tobacco-specific carcinogens, raising the possibility of exposure due to THS re-emission in the NICU. These data justify more formal research documenting acute and cumulative THS exposure, sources of exposure, means of prevention and associations with morbidity/mortality for NICU infants.

Tobacco Control,2016,Peer crowd affiliation as a segmentation tool for young adult tobacco use,Research Article,"['sex', 'sexual orientation']","Background In California, young adult tobacco prevention is of prime importance; 63% of smokers start by the age of 18 years, and 97% start by the age of 26 years. We examined social affiliation with ‘peer crowd’ (eg, Hipsters) as an innovative way to identify high-risk tobacco users. Methods Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2014 (N=3368) among young adult bar patrons in 3 California cities. We examined use rates of five products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, hookah, cigars and smokeless tobacco) by five race/ethnicity categories. Peer crowd affiliation was scored based on respondents' selecting pictures of young adults representing those most and least likely to be in their friend group. Respondents were classified into categories based on the highest score; the peer crowd score was also examined as a continuous predictor. Logistic regression models with each tobacco product as the outcome tested the unique contribution of peer crowd affiliation, controlling for race/ethnicity, age, sex, sexual orientation and city. Results Respondents affiliating with Hip Hop and Hipster peer crowds reported significantly higher rates of tobacco use. As a categorical predictor, peer crowd was related to tobacco use, independent of associations with race/ethnicity. As a continuous predictor, Hip Hop peer crowd affiliation was also associated with tobacco use, and Young Professional affiliation was negatively associated, independent of demographic factors. Conclusions Tobacco product use is not the same across racial/ethnic groups or peer crowds, and peer crowd predicts tobacco use independent of race/ethnicity. Antitobacco interventions targeting peer crowds may be an effective way to reach young adult tobacco users. Trial registration number NCT01686178, Pre-results. ","Young adults use tobacco at high rates, but few studies examine the role of identity and social cultures (eg, peer crowd affiliation) in addition to sociodemographic factors associated with tobacco use despite their common use in marketing campaigns to promote tobacco use. This study found that affiliation with different peer crowds was associated with smoking, independent of race/ethnicity, age, sexual orientation and education. This study also examined multiple non-cigarette tobacco products (e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and smokeless tobacco) and found that peer crowd was independently associated with use of almost all alternative products. Peer crowd affiliation adds additional information to demographics in order to better characterize high risk subgroups of young adults and facilitate development of targeted anti-tobacco campaigns that reflect group membership and values.

Tobacco Control,2016,"Association between menthol-flavoured cigarette smoking and flavoured little cigar and cigarillo use among African-American, Hispanic, and white young and middle-aged adult smokers",Research Article,['gender'],"Objectives Flavour additives in cigarettes and little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs), which influence smokers’ risk perceptions, may reinforce dual flavoured tobacco use. We examined the association among mentholated cigarette use, risk perceptions for flavour additives in LCCs and flavoured LCC smoking behaviour. Methods Data from a national probability sample of 964 young and middle-aged adult current cigarette smokers were analysed. Multinomial logistic regression models examined the relationship among mentholated cigarette smoking, risk perceptions and current flavoured LCC use for the analytic sample and gender and race/ethnicity. Results Daily menthol cigarette smokers, compared to occasional, non-menthol smokers, had increased odds of flavoured LCC smoking (OR=1.75, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.98). This relationship was found for males, blacks/African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos (p<0.05). Positive perceptions of menthol-flavoured additives in LCCs was associated with increased odds of flavoured LCC use among the analytic sample, males and blacks/African-Americans (p<0.05). Positive perceptions for clove-flavoured, spice-flavoured and alcohol-flavoured additives were also associated with flavoured LCC use among the analytic sample (p<0.05). Conclusions Use of menthol-flavoured cigarettes and positive perceptions about menthol-flavoured and other flavour additives in LCCs may contribute to dual use with flavoured LCCs among adult cigarette smokers, specifically those from vulnerable populations. ","Menthol flavoured cigarettes and flavoured little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs) are currently unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has provided the tobacco industry with an unobstructed opportunity to market these products. Flavour additives in cigarettes and LCCs, which influence smokers’ risk perceptions, may reinforce flavoured LCC use. The association of menthol cigarette smoking and risk perceptions about flavoured additives in LCC tobacco with the current use of flavoured versus unflavoured LCCs is unknown. Increasing our understanding of this relationship may help us further understand the potential underlying mechanisms by which the use of a flavoured tobacco product influences other flavoured tobacco product use. Our study found that daily menthol cigarette smoking is associated with greater odds of flavoured LCC use among a national probability sample of black/African-American, Hispanic/Latino, and white young and middle-aged adult cigarette smokers. Our data add to the body of scientific evidence that supports the FDA's ban of all characterising flavours in LCCs.

Tobacco Control,2017,Secondhand hookah smoke: an occupational hazard for hookah bar employees,Research Article,['gender'],"Background Despite the increasing popularity of hookah bars, there is a lack of research assessing the health effects of hookah smoke among employees. This study investigated indoor air quality in hookah bars and the health effects of secondhand hookah smoke on hookah bar workers. Methods Air samples were collected during the work shift of 10 workers in hookah bars in New York City (NYC). Air measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), fine black carbon (BC2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), and nicotine were collected during each work shift. Blood pressure and heart rate, markers of active smoking and secondhand smoke exposure (exhaled CO and saliva cotinine levels), and selected inflammatory cytokines in blood (ineterleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, interferon γ (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α)) were assessed in workers immediately prior to and immediately after their work shift. Results The PM2.5 (gravimetric) and BC2.5 concentrations in indoor air varied greatly among the work shifts with mean levels of 363.8 µg/m3 and 2.2 µg/m3, respectively. The mean CO level was 12.9 ppm with a peak value of 22.5 ppm CO observed in one hookah bar. While heart rate was elevated by 6 bpm after occupational exposure, this change was not statistically significant. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in blood were all increased at postshift compared to preshift testing with IFN-Υ increasing from 0.85 (0.13) to 1.6 (0.25) (mean (standard error of the mean; SEM)) pg/mL (p<0.01). Exhaled CO levels were significantly elevated after the work shift with 2 of 10 workers having values >90 ppm exhaled CO. Conclusions These results demonstrate that hookah bars have elevated concentrations of indoor air pollutants that appear to cause adverse health effects in employees. These data indicate the need for further research and a marked need for better air quality monitoring and policies in such establishments to improve the indoor air quality for workers and patrons. ","This is the very first study to investigate the effects of secondhand hookah smoke on workers in hookah bars. Prior to this study there were no data on this subject. It is not known what the acute effects of such exposure is on pulmonary function and cardiovascular function. It is not known if the observed effects would differ in varying sized and ventilated hookah bars; by exposure to different types of shisha; or by characteristics of workers such as age, gender and underlying health conditions. The long-term consequences of such exposure to workers in such establishments are not known. As a result of this study, we know that there are adverse cardiopulmonary effects in hookah bar workers caused by exposure to secondhand hookah smoke during work shifts. As hookah bars proliferate in the USA and worldwide, these findings suggest that large numbers of workers in these venues will be adversely affected, providing vitally needed information for public health officials, policy makers and clinicians.

Tobacco Control,2017,Estimating the size of illicit tobacco consumption in Brazil: findings from the global adult tobacco survey,Research Article,['gender'],"Background Brazil experienced a large decline in smoking prevalence between 2008 and 2013. Tax rate increases since 2007 and a new tobacco tax structure in 2012 may have played an important role in this decline. However, continuous tax rate increases pushed up cigarette prices over personal income growth and, therefore, some consumers, especially lower income individuals, may have migrated to cheaper illicit cigarettes. Objective To use tobacco surveillance data to estimate the size of illicit tobacco consumption before and after excise tax increases. Methods We defined a threshold price and compared it with purchasing prices obtained from two representative surveys conducted in 2008 and 2013 to estimate the proportion of illicit cigarette use among daily smokers. Generalised linear model was specified to understand whether the absolute difference in proportions over time differed by sociodemographic groups and consumption levels. Our findings were validated using an alternative method. Results Total proportion of illicit daily consumption increased from 16.6% to 31.1% between 2008 and 2013. We observed a pattern of unadjusted absolute decreases in cigarette smoking prevalence and increases in the proportion of illicit consumption, irrespective of gender, age, educational level, area of residence and amount of cigarettes consumed. Conclusions The strategy of raising taxes has increased government revenues, reduced smoking prevalence and resulted in an increased illicit trade. Surveillance data can be used to provide information on illicit tobacco trade to help in the implementation of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) article 15 and the FCTC Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products. ","Assessments of the tobacco illicit market are mostly made by the tobacco industry. Academic and statistical-based studies have found that industry-funded assessments tend to overestimate the size of the illicit market. This study used tobacco surveillance data to estimate the extent of illicit tobacco consumption before and after excise tax increases. The strategy of raising taxes has increased government revenues. Moreover, we observed a pattern of unadjusted absolute decreases in cigarette smoking prevalence and increases in the proportion of illicit consumption, irrespective of gender, age, educational level and amount of cigarettes consumed. Surveillance data can be used to provide information on illicit tobacco trade to help in the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) article 15 and the FCTC Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products.

Tobacco Control,2017,Tobacco price increase and smoking behaviour changes in various subgroups: a nationwide longitudinal 7-year follow-up study among a middle-aged Japanese population,Research Article,['gender'],"Objective Few longitudinal studies have examined the effect of tobacco price increase on both cessation among smokers and relapse among quitters. Our objective was to investigate the differential impact of the tobacco price increase on the changes in smoking status in the total population and various subgroups. Methods We analysed data from a Japanese nationally representative longitudinal study of 30 773 individuals aged 50–59 years (weighted sum of discrete-time number = 215 411) with smoking information, using inverse probability weighting to account for non-response at follow-up. Generalised estimating equation models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for smoking behavioural changes (cessation among smokers and relapse among quitters), using discrete-time design. Stratified analyses were conducted according to demographic, socioeconomic and health behavioural characteristics. Results From 2005 to 2012, current smoker prevalence among the middle-aged Japanese population decreased from 30.5% to 24.3%. Of all the factors surveyed, only the tobacco price increase in 2010 (up by 37%, the highest increase during the period) was significantly associated with both cessation among smokers (OR 2.14, 95% confidence interval 1.90 to 2.41) and prevention of relapse among quitters (0.60, 0.46 to 0.77). Regarding the subgroup analysis, the tobacco price increase was associated with a significant reduction in relapse in the lowest income, recent quitters and very poor health subgroups. However, different associations were observed for cessation; a significant association between price increase and cessation was observed among all subgroups except for the heavy smoker and recently unemployed subgroups. Conclusions We confirmed that the tobacco price rise was associated with increasing cessation and decreasing relapse concurrently. Furthermore, this price rise was associated with favourable smoking changes in nearly all population subgroups; a large differential impact was not observed across the various subgroups. ","What is already known on this topic? The impact of tobacco price increases on smoking behaviour in different social groups has been investigated; mixed results have been reported for differences in gender, occupation and education subgroups. Since few previous studies focused on the impact of price on relapse, longitudinal studies that have examined the effect of tobacco price on both cessation and relapse are scarce. What this study adds? Of all the factors surveyed, only the tobacco price increase in 2010 was significantly associated with cessation (100% increase) and relapse (40% decrease). The tobacco price rise was associated with favourable smoking changes in nearly all population subgroups.

Tobacco Control,2017,Two-year trends and predictors of e-cigarette use in 27 European Union member states,Research Article,['gender'],"Objective This study assessed changes in levels of ever use, perceptions of harm from e-cigarettes and sociodemographic correlates of use among European Union (EU) adults during 2012–2014, as well as determinants of current use in 2014. Methods We analysed data from the 2012 (n=26 751) and 2014 (n=26 792) waves of the adult Special Eurobarometer for Tobacco survey. Point prevalence of current and ever use was calculated and logistic regression assessed correlates of current use and changes in ever use, and perception of harm. Correlates examined included age, gender, tobacco smoking, education, area of residence, difficulties in paying bills and reasons for trying an e-cigarette. Results The prevalence of ever use of e-cigarettes increased from 7.2% in 2012 to 11.6% in 2014 (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.91). EU-wide coefficient of variation in ever e-cigarette use was 42.1% in 2012 and 33.4% in 2014. The perception that e-cigarettes are harmful increased from 27.1% in 2012 to 51.6% in 2014 (aOR=2.99), but there were major differences in prevalence and trends between member states. Among those who reported that they had ever tried an e-cigarette in the 2014 survey, 15.3% defined themselves as current users. Those who tried an e-cigarette to quit smoking were more likely to be current users (aOR=2.82). Conclusions Ever use of e-cigarettes increased during 2012–2014. People who started using e-cigarettes to quit smoking tobacco were more likely to be current users, but the trends vary by country. These findings underscore the need for more research into factors influencing e-cigarette use and its potential benefits and harms. ","Ever use of e-cigarette in the European Union (EU) increased from 7.2% in 2012 to 11.6% in 2014. EU residents were more likely to consider e-cigarettes as harmful in 2014 (51.6%) than in 2012 (27.1%). Those who started using e-cigarettes in order to quit smoking or circumvent smoking bans were more likely to become regular users. A better understanding of the population-level use and impact of e-cigarettes within the EU is needed, especially of the potential impact on smoke-free laws, smoking initiation and cessation.

Tobacco Control,2017,"Contribution of smoking to socioeconomic inequalities in mortality: a study of 14 European countries, 1990–2004",Research Article,['gender'],"Background Smoking contributes to socioeconomic inequalities in mortality, but the extent to which this contribution has changed over time and driven widening or narrowing inequalities in total mortality remains unknown. We studied socioeconomic inequalities in smoking-attributable mortality and their contribution to inequalities in total mortality in 1990–1994 and 2000–2004 in 14 European countries. Methods We collected, harmonised and standardised population-wide data on all-cause and lung-cancer mortality by age, gender, educational and occupational level in 14 European populations in 1990–1994 and 2000–2004. Smoking-attributable mortality was indirectly estimated using the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth method. Results In 2000–2004, smoking-attributable mortality was higher in lower socioeconomic groups in all countries among men, and in all countries except Spain, Italy and Slovenia, among women, and the contribution of smoking to socioeconomic inequalities in mortality varied between 19% and 55% among men, and between −1% and 56% among women. Since 1990–1994, absolute inequalities in smoking-attributable mortality and the contribution of smoking to inequalities in total mortality have decreased in most countries among men, but increased among women. Conclusions In many European countries, smoking has become less important as a determinant of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality among men, but not among women. Inequalities in smoking remain one of the most important entry points for reducing inequalities in mortality. ","It is known that socioeconomic inequalities in smoking have increased in many European countries. It is not well known to what extent smoking trends have contributed to narrowing or widening socioeconomic inequalities in total mortality. This study shows that, over time, smoking has become less important as a determinant of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality among men, but not among women. Our results imply that smoking remains one of the most important entry points for policies to tackle health inequalities.

Tobacco Control,2017,Design and methods of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study,Research Article,['gender'],"Background This paper describes the methods and conceptual framework for Wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data collection. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Institute on Drug Abuse, is partnering with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products to conduct the PATH Study under a contract with Westat. Methods The PATH Study is a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort study of 45 971 adults and youth in the USA, aged 12 years and older. Wave 1 was conducted from 12 September 2013 to 15 December 2014 using Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing to collect information on tobacco-use patterns, risk perceptions and attitudes towards current and newly emerging tobacco products, tobacco initiation, cessation, relapse behaviours and health outcomes. The PATH Study's design allows for the longitudinal assessment of patterns of use of a spectrum of tobacco products, including initiation, cessation, relapse and transitions between products, as well as factors associated with use patterns. Additionally, the PATH Study collects biospecimens from consenting adults aged 18 years and older and measures biomarkers of exposure and potential harm related to tobacco use. Conclusions The cumulative, population-based data generated over time by the PATH Study will contribute to the evidence base to inform FDA's regulatory mission under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and efforts to reduce the Nation's burden of tobacco-related death and disease. ","1. Identify and explain between-person differences and within-person changes in tobacco-use patterns. 2. Identify between-person differences and within-person changes in risk perceptions regarding harmful and potentially harmful constituents, new and emerging tobacco products, tobacco design features, packaging and labelling and identify other factors that may affect use. 3. Characterise the natural history of tobacco dependence, cessation and relapse. 4. Assess between-person differences and within-person changes over time in health conditions potentially related to tobacco use, including markers of exposure and tobacco-related disease processes identified from the collection and analysis of biospecimens. 5. Assess the association between implementing the TCA and tobacco product use, risk perceptions, attitudes, use patterns, cessation outcomes and tobacco-related intermediate end points. 6. Assess between-person differences and within-person changes over time in attitudes, behaviours, exposures to tobacco products and related biomarkers among and within population subgroups defined by race/ethnicity, gender, age and risk factors. 7. Assess and compare former and never users of tobacco products for between-person differences and within-person changes over time in relapse and uptake, risk perceptions and indicators of tobacco product exposure and disease processes. 8. Use the PATH Study as a basis for screening respondents for participation in small-scale research studies. In 2009 the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law giving the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broad regulatory authority over the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products. The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study was launched in September 2013 to generate longitudinal epidemiologic data on tobacco use behaviors and health among the US population to inform and to monitor the impact of FDA's tobacco regulatory actions. Information presented in this paper describes the methods and conceptual framework for Wave 1 of the PATH Study data collection, which is intended to serve as the basis for subsequent papers using the PATH Study data.

Tobacco Control,2017,Impact of the Spanish smoking legislations in the adoption of smoke-free rules at home: a longitudinal study in Barcelona (Spain),Research Article,['sex'],"Objective To assess the impact of two Spanish smoking legislations in the adoption of voluntary smoke-free-homes rules in Spain. Methods This is a longitudinal study, before and after the implementation of two national smoking bans (in 2005 and 2010), in a representative sample (n=1245) of non-institutionalised adults (≥16 years) from Barcelona (Spain) surveyed in 2004–2005 and followed up in 2013–2014. The final sample analysed was 736 individuals (400 women and 336 men). We defined smoking rules in the houses as complete (when smoking was not allowed in the household), partial (when smoking was allowed in some places inside the house) or absent (when smoking was allowed everywhere). We calculated relative changes in the prevalence of smoking rules in homes before and after 2 national smoking legislations by means of prevalence ratios (PRs) and their 95% CIs. Results The households with voluntary smoke-free rules (complete or partial) relatively increased 31% after Spanish smoking bans (from 55.6% to 72.6%, p<0.001). The houses with complete rules relatively increased 57% (from 23.9% to 37.6%, p<0.001) whereas the houses with partial rules increased 11% (from 31.7% to 35.0%, p=0.148). The increase of any type of rules (complete and partial) was statistically significantly independent of sex (PR between 1.29 and 1.33), age (PR between 1.24 and 1.33), educational level (PR between 1.19 and 1.47) and minimum age in house (PR between 1.12 and 1.40). However, this increase was statistically and significantly higher only among never smokers (PR=1.46) at baseline. Conclusions The implementation of the smoke-free regulations in public and work places in Spain was associated with an increasing of voluntary adoption of smoke-free rules in homes. According to our data, the Spanish smoking bans did not shift the tobacco consumption from public and work places to private places (homes). ","The implementation of the smoke-free regulations in public and workplaces in Spain (law 28/2005 and law 42/2010) was associated with an increase in voluntary adoption of smoke-free rules in homes, particularly complete smoke-free homes. In houses with partial smoke-free rules, outside areas of the houses (balconies, courtyard, terraces, and gardens) were the places that showed increase in smoking after Spanish smoking bans. According to our data, the Spanish smoke-free bans did not shift the tobacco consumption from public and work places to private places (homes).

Tobacco Control,2017,Tobacco retail outlet restrictions: health and cost impacts from multistate life-table modelling in a national population,Research Article,['sex'],"Background Since there is some evidence that the density and distribution of tobacco retail outlets may influence smoking behaviours, we aimed to estimate the impacts of 4 tobacco outlet reduction interventions in a country with a smoke-free goal: New Zealand (NZ). Methods A multistate life-table model of 16 tobacco-related diseases, using national data by sex, age and ethnicity, was used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and net costs over the remainder of the 2011 NZ population's lifetime. The outlet reduction interventions assumed that increased travel costs can be operationalised as equivalent to price increases in tobacco. Results All 4 modelled interventions led to reductions of >89% of current tobacco outlets after the 10-year phase-in process. The most effective intervention limited sales to half of liquor stores (and nowhere else) at 129 000 QALYs gained over the lifetime of the population (95% UI: 74 100 to 212 000, undiscounted). The per capita QALY gains were up to 5 times greater for Māori (indigenous population) compared to non-Māori. All interventions were cost-saving to the health system, with the largest saving for the liquor store only intervention: US$1.23 billion (95% UI: $0.70 to $2.00 billion, undiscounted). Conclusions These tobacco outlet reductions reduced smoking prevalence, achieved health gains and saved health system costs. Effects would be larger if outlet reductions have additional spill-over effects (eg, smoking denormalisation). While these interventions were not as effective as tobacco tax increases (using the same model), these and other strategies could be combined to maximise health gain and to maximise cost-savings to the health system. ","There is increasing policy and research interest in restrictions on tobacco retail outlet locations and density, including for achieving tobacco endgame goals. This study used an established tobacco control model, modelling reduced outlet availability in terms of increased travel costs, to study four outlet reduction interventions at a country level (New Zealand). It found that the most effective was one that limited tobacco sales to 50% of liquor outlets (and nowhere else). But other interventions, such as retail-free zones around schools, were also effective and also achieved net cost-savings to the health system. The interventions should reduce health inequalities with around five times the per capita health gain for Māori (indigenous) compared to non-Māori. These interventions were still not as effective as increases in tobacco tax (using the same model and assuming outlet reductions can be modelled as a cost increase to the smoker), but ultimately they could be combined with such strategies in comprehensive tobacco control programmes.

Tobacco Control,2017,"Hazards of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and waterpipe in a Middle Eastern Population: a Cohort Study of 50 000 individuals from Iran",Research Article,['sex'],"Background There is limited information about the hazards of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and waterpipe in the Middle East. The aim of this study was to determine the association between different types of tobacco use and earlier death in the Golestan Cohort Study. Methods The Study includes 50 045 adults (aged 40–75 years) from north eastern Iran. The baseline questionnaire (2004–2008) assessed information about use of cigarettes, chewing tobacco (nass) and waterpipe. To assess the use of each type of tobacco compared with never tobacco users, we used Cox regression models adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, area of residence, education and other tobacco used, and stratified by sex, ethnicity and opium use. Results 17% of participants reported a history of cigarette smoking, 7.5% chewing tobacco (nass) and 1.1% smoking waterpipe, and these figures declined in the later birth cohorts. During a median follow-up of 8 years, 4524 deaths occurred (mean age 64.8+9.9 years). Current (HR=1.44; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.61) and former (HR=1.35; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.56) cigarette smokers had higher overall mortality relative to never tobacco users. The highest cigarette-associated risk was for cancer death among current heavy smokers (HR=2.32; 95% CI 1.66 to 3.24). Current nass chewing was associated with overall mortality (HR=1.16; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.34), and there was a 61% higher risk of cancer death in people chewing nass more than five times a day. We observed an association between the cumulative lifetime waterpipe use (waterpipe-years≥28) and both overall (HR=1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.47), and cancer mortality (HR=2.82; 95% CI 1.30 to 6.11). Conclusions Regular use of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and waterpipe were associated with the risk of earlier death (particularly from cancer) in our cohort. ","All types of tobacco increased the risk of earlier death (particularly from cancer) in our study. We also showed increased risk of earlier death, compared to never tobacco users, among people who switched to smokeless tobacco after quitting cigarettes and those who have regularly smoked the waterpipe for a long time. These results emphasise the need for global tobacco control and show that the focus of antitobacco efforts must not be confined to cigarette smoking.

Tobacco Control,2017,Support for e-cigarette policies: a survey of smokers and ex-smokers in Great Britain,Research Article,['gender'],"Introduction E-cigarette regulations are the topic of extensive debate. Approaches vary worldwide, and limited evidence is available on public support for specific policies or what influences support. The present study aimed to assess smokers' and ex-smokers' support for 3 e-cigarette policies: (1) equal or higher availability relative to cigarettes, (2) advertising, (3) use in smoke-free places, and to assess changes in support over time and associations with respondent characteristics. Methods Smokers and ex-smokers (n=1848) provided 3279 observations over 2 waves (2013 and 2014) of a longitudinal web-based survey in Great Britain. Multivariable logistic regressions fitted using generalised estimating equations assessed change in policy support over time, and associations between support and demographics (age, gender and income), smoking and e-cigarette use status, nicotine knowledge and perceived relative harm. Results Equal or higher relative availability was supported by 79% in 2013 and 76% in 2014; advertising by 66% and 56%, respectively; neither change was significant in adjusted analyses. Support for use in smoke-free places decreased significantly from 55% to 45%. Compared with ex-smokers, smokers were more likely to support advertising and use in smoke-free places. Respondents using e-cigarettes, those who perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes, and those with more accurate knowledge about nicotine were more likely to support all 3 policies. Conclusions Less restrictive e-cigarette policies were more likely to be supported by e-cigarette users, and respondents who perceived e-cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes, or knew that nicotine was not a main cause of harm to health. ","This study shows the level of support among smokers and ex-smokers in Great Britain for equal or greater availability of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes, allowing e-cigarette advertising and use in smoke-free places. Support for prohibiting e-cigarette use in smoke-free places increased, and in 2014, very similar proportions (over 40%) supported and opposed a ban. To a lesser extent, support for banning advertising also increased over the study period. Equal or higher availability relative to cigarettes was more likely to be supported by e-cigarette users, those who perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes, and those who knew that most of the health harms of smoking are not due to nicotine. Less restrictive policies for advertising and use in smoke-free places were more likely to be supported by smokers, e-cigarette users, those who perceived e-cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes and those who knew that only a small portion of the health harms of smoking are due to nicotine. These survey findings suggest that, in addition to smoking and e-cigarette use status, accurate knowledge about nicotine and perception of harm are determinants of policy support.

Tobacco Control,2017,Reducing nicotine exposure results in weight gain in smokers randomised to very low nicotine content cigarettes,Research Article,['gender'],"Background The Food and Drug Administration can reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes to very low levels. This potential regulatory action is hypothesised to improve public health by reducing smoking, but may have unintended consequences related to weight gain. Methods Weight gain was evaluated from a double-blind, parallel, randomised clinical trial of 839 participants assigned to smoke 1 of 6 investigational cigarettes with nicotine content ranging from 0.4 to 15.8 mg/g or their own usual brand for 6 weeks. Additional analyses evaluated weight gain in the lowest nicotine content cigarette groups (0.4 and 0.4 mg/g, high tar) to examine the effect of study product in compliant participants as assessed by urinary biomarkers. Differences in outcomes due to gender were also explored. Findings There were no significant differences in weight gain when comparing the reduced nicotine conditions with the 15.8 mg/g control group across all treatment groups and weeks. However, weight gain at week 6 was negatively correlated with nicotine exposure in the 2 lowest nicotine content cigarette conditions. Within the 2 lowest nicotine content cigarette conditions, male and female smokers biochemically verified to be compliant on study product gained significantly more weight than non-compliant smokers and control groups. Conclusions The effect of random assignment to investigational cigarettes with reduced nicotine on weight gain was likely obscured by non-compliance with study product. Men and women who were compliant in the lowest nicotine content cigarette conditions gained 1.2 kg over 6 weeks, indicating weight gain is a likely consequence of reduced exposure to nicotine. Trial registration number NCT01681875, Post-results. ","Evidence suggests that the reduction in nicotine content in cigarettes may reduce the public health burden of smoking by increasing quitting. Smoking cessation results in weight gain, an effect attributed to nicotine; however, the impact of smoking very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes on weight has received little attention. The data presented within this manuscript demonstrate that smoking very low nicotine cigarettes results in weight gain comparable to cessation. Future work should develop strategies that minimise weight gain during the use of VLNC cigarettes.

Tobacco Control,2017,Misperceptions of harm among Natural American Spirit smokers: results from wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (2013–2014),Research Article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'questioning', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction This study estimated differences in cigarette harm perceptions among smokers of the Natural American Spirit (NAS) brand—marketed as ‘natural’, ‘organic’ and ‘additive-free’—compared to other smokers, and examined correlates of NAS use. Methods Data were drawn from wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study, a nationally representative study of US adults (2013–2014). Weighted analyses using a subset of current adult smokers (n=10 565) estimated the prevalence of NAS use (vs all other brands) and examined associations between NAS use and sociodemographics, tobacco/substance use, tobacco harm perceptions, quit intentions, quit attempts and mental/behavioural health. Results Overall, 2.3% of adult smokers (920 000 people in the USA) reported NAS as their usual brand. Nearly 64% of NAS smokers inaccurately believed that their brand is less harmful than other brands compared to 8.3% of smokers of other brands, after controlling for potential confounders (aOR 22.82). Younger age (18–34 vs 35+; aOR 1.54), frequent thinking about tobacco harms (aOR 1.84), past 30-day alcohol use (aOR 1.57), past 30-day marijuana use (aOR 1.87) and sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, ‘other’ or ‘questioning’ vs heterosexual; aOR 2.07) were also associated with increased odds of smoking NAS. Conclusions The majority of NAS smokers inaccurately believes that their cigarettes are less harmful than other brands. Given the brand's rapid growth and its more common use in vulnerable groups (eg, young adults, lesbian, gay, bisexual, ‘other’ or ‘questioning’ adults), corrective messaging and enforcement action are necessary to correct harm misperceptions of NAS cigarettes. ","Prior research has revealed that Natural American Spirit (NAS) cigarette pack descriptors and advertising convey reduced harm messages to study participants. Using recent (2013–2014) nationally representative data from the USA, this study shows that, compared to smokers of other brands, NAS smokers are over 22 times more likely to inaccurately believe that their brand is less harmful than other brands. NAS smokers are more likely to be young adults, non-Hispanic White, college educated, past 30-day marijuana and alcohol users, and identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, ‘other’ or ‘questioning’ than smokers of other brands.

Tobacco Control,2018,Potential deaths averted in USA by replacing cigarettes with e-cigarettes,Other,['sex'],"Introduction US tobacco control policies to reduce cigarette use have been effective, but their impact has been relatively slow. This study considers a strategy of switching cigarette smokers to e-cigarette use (‘vaping’) in the USA to accelerate tobacco control progress. Methods A Status Quo Scenario, developed to project smoking rates and health outcomes in the absence of vaping, is compared with Substitution models, whereby cigarette use is largely replaced by vaping over a 10-year period. We test an Optimistic and a Pessimistic Scenario, differing in terms of the relative harms of e-cigarettes compared with cigarettes and the impact on overall initiation, cessation and switching. Projected mortality outcomes by age and sex under the Status Quo and E-Cigarette Substitution Scenarios are compared from 2016 to 2100 to determine public health impacts. Findings Compared with the Status Quo, replacement of cigarette by e-cigarette use over a 10-year period yields 6.6 million fewer premature deaths with 86.7 million fewer life years lost in the Optimistic Scenario. Under the Pessimistic Scenario, 1.6 million premature deaths are averted with 20.8 million fewer life years lost. The largest gains are among younger cohorts, with a 0.5 gain in average life expectancy projected for the age 15 years cohort in 2016. Conclusions The tobacco control community has been divided regarding the role of e-cigarettes in tobacco control. Our projections show that a strategy of replacing cigarette smoking with vaping would yield substantial life year gains, even under pessimistic assumptions regarding cessation, initiation and relative harm. ","The 2014 US Surgeon General’s Report suggested the need for a new strategy to more quickly end tobacco use, but a credible strategy has not been provided. This paper considers a strategy of switching cigarettes smokers to e-cigarette use in USA to accelerate tobacco control progress. Using a previously validated simulation model, our projections show that a strategy of replacing cigarette smoking with e-cigarette use would yield substantial life year gains, even under pessimistic assumptions regarding cessation, initiation and relative harm.

Tobacco Control,2018,Educational and wealth inequalities in tobacco use among men and women in 54 low-income and middle-income countries,Research Article,['sex'],"Background Socioeconomic differentials of tobacco smoking in high-income countries are well described. However, studies to support health policies and place monitoring systems to tackle socioeconomic inequalities in smoking and smokeless tobacco use common in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) are seldom reported. We aimed to describe, sex-wise, educational and wealth-related inequalities in tobacco use in LMICs. Methods We analysed Demographic and Health Survey data on tobacco use collected from large nationally representative samples of men and women in 54 LMICs. We estimated the weighted prevalence of any current tobacco use (including smokeless tobacco) in each country for 4 educational groups and 4 wealth groups. We calculated absolute and relative measures of inequality, that is, the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII), which take into account the distribution of prevalence across all education and wealth groups and account for population size. We also calculated the aggregate SII and RII for low-income (LIC), lower-middle-income (lMIC) and upper-middle-income (uMIC) countries as per World Bank classification. Findings Male tobacco use was highest in Bangladesh (70.3%) and lowest in Sao Tome (7.4%), whereas female tobacco use was highest in Madagascar (21%) and lowest in Tajikistan (0.22%). Among men, educational inequalities varied widely between countries, but aggregate RII and SII showed an inverse trend by country wealth groups. RII was 3.61 (95% CI 2.83 to 4.61) in LICs, 1.99 (95% CI 1.66 to 2.38) in lMIC and 1.82 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.67) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among men varied less between countries, but RII and SII showed an inverse pattern where RII was 2.43 (95% CI 2.05 to 2.88) in LICs, 1.84 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.21) in lMICs and 1.67 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.42) in uMICs. For educational inequalities among women, the RII varied much more than SII varied between the countries, and the aggregate RII was 14.49 (95% CI 8.87 to 23.68) in LICs, 3.05 (95% CI 1.44 to 6.47) in lMIC and 1.58 (95% CI 0.33 to 7.56) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among women showed a pattern similar to that of men: the RII was 5.88 (95% CI 3.91 to 8.85) in LICs, 1.76 (95% CI 0.80 to 3.85) in lMIC and 0.39 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.64) in uMIC. In contrast to men, among women, the SII was pro-rich (higher smoking among the more advantaged) in 13 of the 52 countries (7 of 23 lMIC and 5 of 7 uMIC). Interpretation Our results confirm that socioeconomic inequalities tobacco use exist in LMIC, varied widely between the countries and were much wider in the lowest income countries. These findings are important for better understanding and tackling of socioeconomic inequalities in health in LMIC. ","Tobacco use patterns change over time. Prior reports on socioeconomic inequalities of smoking in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) are outdated and do not reflect the current socioeconomic gradients. We demonstrate that relative and absolute socioeconomic inequalities of tobacco use vary widely across sex, countries as well as by World Bank categories. Tobacco control policies in LMICs may have been less successful in reducing social inequalities in tobacco use over the last decade. The study demonstrates the need for future monitoring of tobacco use in LMICs.

Tobacco Control,2018,Adult smokers’ perceptions of cigarette pack inserts promoting cessation: a focus group study,Other,['gender'],"Introduction Tobacco companies have a long tradition of including promotional material within cigarette packs, such as cigarette cards and coupons. Only in Canada are they required, by the government, to include educational material within cigarette packs, in the form of inserts highlighting the benefits of quitting or providing tips on how to do so. Methods Twenty focus groups were conducted in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 2015, with smokers (n=120) segmented by age (16–17, 18–24, 25–35, 36–50, >50), gender and social grade, to explore perceptions of the inserts used in Canada. Results The consensus was that these inserts would capture attention and be read due to their novelty and visibility before reaching the cigarettes, and as they can be removed from the pack. While they may be ignored or discarded, and rotation was considered necessary, they were generally thought to prolong the health message. The positive style of messaging was described as refreshing, educational, encouraging, reassuring and inspirational and thought to increase message engagement. It was regarded as more sympathetic than command-style messaging, offering smokers ‘a bit of hope’. The inserts were often considered preferable to the on-pack warnings, although it was felt that both were needed. Some participants suggested that inserts could encourage them to stop smoking, and they were generally viewed as having the potential to alter the behaviour of others, particularly younger people, would-be smokers and those wanting to quit. Conclusions Inserts are an inexpensive means of communication and offer regulators a simple way of supplementing on-pack warnings. ","This study explores Scottish smokers’ response to pack inserts used in Canada, which feature coloured graphics and messages highlighting the benefits of quitting or providing tips on how to do so. The inserts were thought to capture attention, increase message engagement, supplement the on-pack warnings, prolong the health message and potentially influence the behaviour of younger people, would-be smokers and smokers wanting to quit. Inserts are a simple and inexpensive means of communicating with smokers and a viable option for regulators.

Tobacco Control,2018,Modelling the implications of reducing smoking prevalence: the public health and economic benefits of achieving a ‘tobacco-free’ UK,Other,['sex'],"Introduction Smoking is still the most preventable cause of cancer, and a leading cause of premature mortality and health inequalities in the UK. This study modelled the health and economic impacts of achieving a ‘tobacco-free’ ambition (TFA) where, by 2035, less than 5% of the population smoke tobacco across all socioeconomic groups. Methods A non-linear multivariate regression model was fitted to cross-sectional smoking data to create projections to 2035. These projections were used to predict the future incidence and costs of 17 smoking-related diseases using a microsimulation approach. The health and economic impacts of achieving a TFA were evaluated against a predicted baseline scenario, where current smoking trends continue. Results If trends continue, the prevalence of smoking in the UK was projected to be 10% by 2035—well above a TFA. If this ambition were achieved by 2035, it could mean 97 300 +/- 5 300 new cases of smoking-related diseases are avoided by 2035 (tobacco-related cancers: 35 900+/- 4 100; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 29 000 +/- 2 700; stroke: 24 900 +/- 2 700; coronary heart disease: 7600 +/- 2 700), including around 12 350 diseases avoided in 2035 alone. The consequence of this health improvement is predicted to avoid £67 +/- 8 million in direct National Health Service and social care costs, and £548 million in non-health costs, in 2035 alone. Conclusion These findings strengthen the case to set bold targets on long-term declines in smoking prevalence to achieve a tobacco ‘endgame’. Results demonstrate the health and economic benefits that meeting a TFA can achieve over just 20 years. Effective ambitions and policy interventions are needed to reduce the disease and economic burden of smoking. ","Risk factor data Historical and current prevalence of smoker status (never smoker, ex-smoker and smoker) broken down by age, sex and income quintile. Disease data Most recent incidence, mortality and survival of the diseases of interest, broken down by age and sex. Relative risk of acquiring the diseases of interest, broken down by age and sex. Demographic data Most recent UK population, broken down by age and sex. Most recent mortality and fertility rates of the UK population. Health economic data Mean utility weights of the diseases of interest without medical intervention. Most recent direct healthcare (National Health Service) costs associated with the diseases of interest. Most recent non-healthcare costs (non-health societal costs) associated with the diseases of interest. Understanding the impact of changes to smoking prevalence through simulation models is important for policy planning and understanding the costs of inaction. This paper strengthens the currently small evidence base, both in the UK and internationally, that uses microsimulation modelling to understand the impact of reduced smoking prevalence on disease and economic outcomes. Strategies that achieve a tobacco ‘endgame’ could deliver substantially improved health outcomes. However, such ambitions have not yet been readily adopted internationally and the evidence base on the benefits of achieving such ambitions is an emergent area of research. For the first time to our knowledge, this paper communicates the benefits that a ‘tobacco-free’ ambition could bring on lessening the disease and economic burden caused by smoking in the UK.

Tobacco Control,2018,Randomised controlled trial of stand-alone tailored emails for smoking cessation,Other,['gender'],"Introduction Digital technology has created opportunities for delivering smoking cessation assistance at the population level. However, the efficacy of sending multiple, automated, tailored emails providing motivation, support and information for quitting is unknown. Methods Smokers planning to quit (n=1070) were randomly assigned to (1) 27 tailored cessation emails (deluxe email group (DEG)), (2) 3 to 4 tailored emails with links to downloadable booklets (basic email group (BEG)) or (3) a single non-tailored email (single email group (SEG)). All emails included links to quitting resources. Self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence was assessed at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postenrolment. Results Across follow-ups, abstinence was significantly greater for smokers in the DEG (34%) compared with the SEG (25.8%; OR=1.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.02, p=0.02) but there was no difference between the BEG (30.8%) and the SEG (p=0.13). Results were independent of baseline cigarettes per day, interest in quitting, smoker in household, use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline and gender, themselves associated with abstinence (ps<0.05). Missing=smoking and multiple imputation analyses based on 25 data sets corroborated results. Participants in the DEG were also more likely to use non-medication aids (eg, quit smoking website, cessation class/clinic) compared with the SEG (OR=1.34, p=0.02, CI 1.06 to 1.71), but use of these or NRT by the 4-week follow-up (vs no use) increased abstinence across follow-ups primarily for those in the SEG. Conclusions Stand-alone tailored, multiple emails providing support, motivation and information during a quit attempt are an easily deployable, inexpensive mode of providing effective cessation assistance to large numbers of smokers planning to quit. ","Providing cessation assistance to smokers at the population level is now possible with digital technology. Expanding the options available to smokers for receiving quitting assistance has the potential to increase abstinence rates and decrease the prevalence of smoking. No randomised trial has tested the efficacy of supportive, stand-alone, tailored email(s) sent over the course of a quit attempt, to help smokers achieve greater abstinence compared with a control. Sending smokers multiple tailored emails during a quit attempt, based on minimal information such as quit date, social support person, top two reasons for quitting, top five triggers for smoking and intended use of cessation medications, yields quit rates superior to a control email that provides information on quitting resources. For smokers planning to quit in the next 30 days this approach can be a low-cost, low-effort, evidence-based option that can be easily implemented and disseminated to the public (and adapted for vulnerable populations).

Tobacco Control,2018,Do electronic cigarettes increase cigarette smoking in UK adolescents? Evidence from a 12-month prospective study,Other,['sex'],"Background In cross-sectional surveys, increasing numbers of adolescents report using both electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and cigarettes. This study assessed whether adolescent e-cigarette use was associated prospectively with initiation or escalation of cigarette use. Methods Data were from 2836 adolescents (aged 13–14 years at baseline) in 20 schools in England. At baseline, breath carbon monoxide levels, self-reported e-cigarette and cigarette use, sex, age, friends and family smoking, beliefs about cigarette use and percentage receiving free school meals (measure of socioeconomic status) were assessed. At 12-month follow-up, self-reported cigarette use was assessed and validated by breath carbon monoxide levels. Results At baseline, 34.2% of adolescents reported ever using e-cigarettes (16.0% used only e-cigarettes). Baseline ever use of e-cigarettes was strongly associated with subsequent initiation (n=1726; OR 5.38, 95% CI 4.02 to 7.22; controlling for covariates, OR 4.06, 95% CI 2.94 to 5.60) and escalation (n=318; OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.21; controlling for covariates, this effect became non-significant, OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.82) of cigarette use. Conclusions This is the first study to report prospective relationships between ever use of e-cigarettes and initiation and escalation of cigarette use among UK adolescents. Ever use of e-cigarettes was robustly associated with initiation but more modestly related to escalation of cigarette use. Further research with longer follow-up in a broader age range of adolescents is required. ","Previous research: In cross-sectional surveys of UK adolescents, electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is increasing, cigarette use is decreasing and increasing numbers of adolescents report using both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Several studies among US adolescents suggest that self-reported e-cigarette use is associated with subsequent initiation of cigarette use, whereas one study in US adolescents found no association between e-cigarette use and escalation of cigarette use. However, these studies were all conducted in the USA, did not validate their self-reported smoking measures against objective measures and assessed only a limited range of risk factors for smoking as covariates and moderators of these relationships. Interpretation: Associations similar to those found in the previous studies are reported in a sample of UK adolescents and are validated against breath CO measures. Data collected over a 12-month period confirmed a sizeable relationship between ever use of e-cigarettes and subsequent initiation of cigarette use and showed that e-cigarette use is modestly associated with subsequent escalation of cigarette use. The former but not the latter relationship remained after controlling for various other risk factors for smoking (eg, intentions to smoke), only some of which had been assessed in previous studies. These findings support the robustness of the relationship between ever use of e-cigarettes and initiation of cigarette use but suggest the relationship between ever use of e-cigarettes and escalation of cigarette use may be explainable by other factors. Ever use of e-cigarettes was a stronger predictor of initiation of cigarette use in those with no friends who smoked at baseline compared with those with a few or most friends who smoked at baseline. The latter finding would not appear to be consistent with the suggestion that e-cigarette use may simply be a marker for those who would go on to smoke cigarettes even without having tried e-cigarettes.

Tobacco Control,2018,Relationship between trying an electronic cigarette and subsequent cigarette experimentation in Scottish adolescents: a cohort study,Other,['sex'],"Background This study examines whether young never smokers in Scotland, UK, who have tried an e-cigarette are more likely than those who have not, to try a cigarette during the following year. Methods Prospective cohort survey conducted in four high schools in Scotland, UK during February/March 2015 (n=3807) with follow-up 1 year later. All pupils (age 11–18) were surveyed. Response rates were high in both years (87% in 2015) and 2680/3807 (70.4%) of the original cohort completed the follow-up survey. Analysis was restricted to baseline ‘never smokers’ (n=3001/3807), 2125 of whom were available to follow-up (70.8%). Results At baseline, 183 of 2125 (8.6%) never smokers had tried an e-cigarette and 1942 had not. Of the young people who had not tried an e-cigarette at baseline, 249 (12.8%) went on to try smoking a cigarette by follow-up. This compares with 74 (40.4%) of those who had tried an e-cigarette at baseline. This effect remained significant in a logistic regression model adjusted for smoking susceptibility, having friends who smoke, family members’ smoking status, age, sex, family affluence score, ethnic group and school (adjusted OR 2.42 (95% CI 1.63 to 3.60)). There was a significant interaction between e-cigarette use and smoking susceptibility and between e-cigarette use and smoking within the friendship group. Conclusions Young never smokers are more likely to experiment with cigarettes if they have tried an e-cigarette. Causality cannot be inferred, but continued close monitoring of e-cigarette use in young people is warranted. ","Eight prospective studies in the USA have reported a temporal relationship between trying an e-cigarette and subsequent experimentation with cigarettes. Consistent with the US studies, this study indicates a positive relationship between e-cigarette use in never smokers and their subsequent first experimentation with cigarettes by follow-up 1 year later. This UK study found that e-cigarette use had a greater impact on the odds of cigarette experimentation in young never smokers not traditionally thought to be high risk, that is, those with a firm intention not to smoke and/or no smokers in their friendship group.

Tobacco Control,2018,Trends in cigarette consumption and time to first cigarette on awakening from 2002 to 2015 in the USA: new insights into the ongoing tobacco epidemic,Other,['gender'],"Objective The current study estimates trends in the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and percentage of smokers having their first CPD within 30 min of waking (time to first cigarette (TTFC)<30 min) among smokers from 2002 to 2015 in the USA overall, and adjusting for demographics. Trends in TTFC<30 min were also estimated by varying levels of cigarette consumption. Methods Data were drawn from the National Household Survey on Drug Use, an annual nationally representative cross-sectional study of the US population aged 12 and older (n=54 079–58 397 per year). Linear time trend analyses of CPD and TTFC<30 min were conducted adjusting for age, gender and income; linear time trend analyses of TTFC among those at varying levels of CPD were then performed. Results Estimates suggest that CPD declined overall from 2002 to 2015, and that the prevalence of TTFC<30 min declined overall among smokers (p<0.0001). The proportion of smokers consuming fewer (ie, 1–5, 6–15) CPD has increased while the number consuming 16+ CPD has decreased overall. Among those smoking 1–5 (p=0.0006) and 6–15 (p<0.0001) CPD, TTFC<30 min has increased significantly, but TTFC<30 min has remained unchanged among those smoking 16 or more CPD (p=0.5838). Conclusions Findings suggest that smokers today are consuming fewer CPD, yet are increasingly likely to have their first cigarette earlier on awakening than they were a decade ago. Intervention and outreach efforts aimed at moving the prevalence lower may benefit from evaluating and addressing nicotine dependence even among lighter smokers. ","Despite declines over the past several decades, smoking remains a major public health problem in the USA. Short time to first cigarette upon awakening in the morning (TTFC<30 min) and number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) are two key indicators of difficulty quitting smoking. Prior work suggests a steady decline in daily cigarette consumption overall. No prior study has examined whether there have been changes in TTFC (<30 min) among those at various levels of CPD. Results suggest that while the proportion of smokers consuming 16+ CPD has decreased, the proportion consuming 1-5 CPD and 6-15 CPD has increased over the past decade. TTFC (<30 min) has increased among those smoking fewer CPD (i.e., 1-5, 6-15) over time, but appears unchanged among those smoking 16+ CPD. Intervention and outreach efforts aimed at moving the prevalence lower may benefit from evaluating and addressing nicotine dependence among lighter smokers.

Tobacco Control,2018,"Young adult smokers’ perceptions of plain packs, numbered packs and pack inserts in Turkey: a focus group study",Other,['straight'],"Introduction The Turkish Government’s ‘National Tobacco Control Program 2015–2018’ included plans to introduce plain packaging and also a ban on brand names on cigarette packs, allowing only assigned numbers on packs. We explored perceptions of these proposed measures, and also pack inserts with cessation messages, another novel way of using the packaging to communicate with consumers. Methods Eight focus groups were conducted with 47 young adult smokers in Manisa and Kutahya (Turkey) in December 2016. Participants were shown three straight-edged plain cigarette packs, as required in Australia, and then three bevelled-edged plain packs, as permitted in the UK. They were then shown plain packs with numbers rather than brand names, and finally three pack inserts with messages encouraging quitting or offering tips on how to do so. Participants were asked about their perceptions of each. Results Plain packs were considered unappealing and off-putting, although the bevelled-edged packs were viewed more favourably than the straight-edged packs. Numbered packs were thought by some to diminish the appeal created by the brand name and potentially decrease interest among never smokers and newer smokers. Pack inserts were thought to have less of an impact than the on-pack warnings, but could potentially help discourage initiation and encourage cessation. Conclusions That bevelled-edged plain packs were perceived more positively than straight-edged plain packs is relevant to countries planning to introduce plain packaging. The study provides a first insight into smokers’ perceptions of a ban on brand names, which was perceived to reduce appeal among young people. ","Bevelled-edged plain packs were considered more appealing than straight-edged plain packs, which has implications for plain pack design. The study explored, for the first time, perceptions of numbers on packs rather than brand names. Numbered packs were thought to reduce the appeal of cigarettes for younger people and new smokers. Inserts were thought to be less effective than the on-pack warnings, but nevertheless were viewed as a deterrent for younger people, new smokers and those intending to quit.

Tobacco Control,2018,Modelling the implications of reducing smoking prevalence: the benefits of increasing the UK tobacco duty escalator to public health and economic outcomes,Other,['sex'],"Introduction Taxing tobacco is one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking prevalence, mitigate its devastating consequential health harms and progress towards a tobacco-free society. This study modelled the health and economic impacts of increasing the existing cigarette tobacco duty escalator (TDE) in the UK from the current 2% above consumer price inflation to 5%. Methods A two-stage modelling process was used. First, a non-linear multivariate regression model was fitted to cross-sectional smoking data, creating longitudinal projections from 2015 to 2035. Second, these projections were used to predict the future incidence, prevalence and cost of 17 smoking-related diseases using a Monte Carlo microsimulation approach. A sustained increase in the duty escalator was evaluated against a baseline of continuing historical smoking trends and the existing duty escalator. Results A sustained increase in the TDE is projected to reduce adult smoking prevalence to 6% in 2035, from 10% in a baseline scenario. After increasing the TDE, only 65% of female and 60% of male would-be smokers would actually be smoking in 2035. The intervention is projected to avoid around 75 200 new cases of smoking-related diseases between 2015 and 2035. In 2035 alone, £49 m in National Health Service and social care costs and £192 m in societal premature mortality and morbidity costs are projected to be avoided. Conclusion Increasing the UK TDE to 5% above inflation could effectively reduce smoking prevalence, prevent diseases and avoid healthcare costs. It would deliver substantial progress towards a tobacco-free society and should be implemented by the UK Government with urgency. ","Risk factor data Historical and current prevalence of smoker status (never smoker, ex-smoker and smoker) by age, sex and income quintile Disease data Most recent incidence, mortality and survival of the diseases of interest, by age and sex Relative risk of acquiring the diseases of interest by age and sex Demographic data Most recent UK population by age and sex Most recent mortality and fertility rates of the UK population Health economic data Mean utility weights of the diseases of interest without medical intervention Most recent direct National Health Service costs associated with the diseases of interest Most recent indirect societal costs associated with the diseases of interest Tobacco duty escalator assumptions Overall average retail price of cigarettes: £7.1343 Price of hand-rolled tobacco (HR-T): £7.8944 Price elasticity: −0.5 for cigarettes and −1.17 for HR-T45 Consumer price index: 2% Level of taxation Value-added tax at 20% Ad valorem duty at 16.5% Specific duty would increase from £176.20 per 1000 cigarettes in 201344 Pass on rate: 100% Illicit trade: 10% of the total market This paper is the first to calculate the substantially improved health outcomes that could be delivered from increasing the tobacco duty escalator (TDE) in the UK. Increasing the TDE on cigarettes from 2% to 5% above inflation could reduce smoking prevalence from an estimated 10% to around 6% in the UK, avoiding around 75 200 cases of disease in the next 20 years. Increasing the TDE would also have a substantial impact on reducing costs to the National Health Service, social care and wider society.

Tobacco Control,2018,Reassessing the importance of ‘lost pleasure’ associated with smoking cessation: implications for social welfare and policy,Other,['sex'],"Introduction Benefit–cost analyses of tobacco regulations include estimates of the informed choice of smokers to continue smoking. Few studies have focused on subjective feelings associated with continued smoking. This study estimates how smoker discontent and regret relate to risk perceptions and health concerns. Methods We analysed data from a 2015 nationally representative, online survey of 1284 US adult current smokers. Information was collected on regret, intention to quit, perceived addiction, risk perceptions and health concerns. Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographics and health status was used to examine factors associated with smoker discontent. Results More than 80% of current smokers report high (22.5%) or very high (59.8%) discontent due to inability to quit, perceived addiction and regret about having started to smoke. Higher levels of discontent did not vary significantly by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education or income (adjusted odds ratios (AORs) 0.5–1.2). Compared with the smokers expressing low (5.9%) or very low (3.6%) discontent, those expressing higher levels of discontent perceived their health status as fair/poor (AOR=2.3), worried most of the time about lung cancer (AOR=4.6) and felt they were more likely to develop lung cancer in the future (AOR=5.1). Conclusion The proportion of smokers who might be characterised as having a preference to continue smoking are greatly outnumbered by addicted, discontent and concerned smokers who want to quit and regret ever having started to smoke. These discontent smokers could have a substantial net welfare gain if new regulations helped them escape their concerns about the health effects from continuing smoking. ","There is significant debate about how the benefit–cost analysis of tobacco regulations in the USA should be conducted. A ‘rational benchmark’ approach has been recommended to replace the standard structural welfare analysis (eg, estimating consumer surplus or ‘lost pleasure’) grounded in rational choice theory. Limited data are available to define preference to continue smoking based on subjective feelings of regret about having started to smoke, discontent with inability to quit and perceived risk of disease and premature death caused by continuing to smoke. Most smokers report feeling addicted, discontent and concerned and therefore want to quit and regret ever having started to smoke. The proportion of smokers reporting no regret about having started to smoke, not feeling addicted and never planning to quit is very small. The study findings support the inclusion of a reduction in smokers’ discontent and an improvement in subjective well-being in cost and benefit analyses of the economic impact of tobacco regulations.

Tobacco Control,2018,Smoke-free legislation and paediatric hospitalisations for acute respiratory tract infections: national quasi-experimental study with unexpected findings and important methodological implications,Other,['sex'],"Objectives We investigated whether Scottish implementation of smoke-free legislation was associated with a reduction in unplanned hospitalisations or deaths (‘events’) due to respiratory tract infections (RTIs) among children. Design Interrupted time series (ITS). Setting/participants Children aged 0–12 years living in Scotland during 1996–2012. Intervention National comprehensive smoke-free legislation (March 2006). Main outcome measure Acute RTI events in the Scottish Morbidity Record-01 and/or National Records of Scotland Death Records. Results 135 134 RTI events were observed over 155 million patient-months. In our prespecified negative binomial regression model accounting for underlying temporal trends, seasonality, sex, age group, region, urbanisation level, socioeconomic status and seven-valent pneumococcal vaccination status, smoke-free legislation was associated with an immediate rise in RTI events (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.24, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.28) and an additional gradual increase (IRR=1.05/year, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.06). Given this unanticipated finding, we conducted a number of post hoc exploratory analyses. Among these, automatic break point detection indicated that the rise in RTI events actually preceded the smoke-free law by 16 months. When accounting for this break point, smoke-free legislation was associated with a gradual decrease in acute RTI events: IRR=0.91/year, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96. Conclusions Our prespecified ITS approach suggested that implementation of smoke-free legislation in Scotland was associated with an increase in paediatric RTI events. We were concerned that this result, which contradicted published evidence, was spurious. The association was indeed reversed when accounting for an unanticipated antecedent break point in the temporal trend, suggesting that the legislation may in fact be protective. ITS analyses should be subjected to comprehensive robustness checks to assess consistency. ","Implementation of comprehensive smoke-free legislation is associated with significant early-life health benefits, including reductions in severe paediatric respiratory events. Evidence on the impact of national policies typically is derived from quasi-experimental studies; given their inherent risks of bias and confounding, replication of such studies across various settings is essential. We investigated if the March 2006 national implementation of comprehensive smoke-free legislation in Scotland was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions/deaths due to acute respiratory tract infections among children. Our prespecified interrupted time series approach suggested that implementation of smoke-free legislation in Scotland was associated with an increase in paediatric respiratory tract infection admissions/deaths. We were concerned that this result, which contradicted published evidence, was spurious. The association was indeed reversed when accounting for an unanticipated antecedent break point in the temporal trend, suggesting that the legislation may in fact be protective. We discuss the findings from this national study and propose approaches to enhancing the methodological quality of interrupted time series studies.

Tobacco Control,2018,"Impact of increasing tobacco taxes on working-age adults: short-term health gain, health equity and cost savings",Other,['sex'],"Objective The health gains and cost savings from tobacco tax increase peak many decades into the future. Policy-makers may take a shorter-term perspective and be particularly interested in the health of working-age adults (given their role in economic productivity). Therefore, we estimated the impact of tobacco taxes in this population within a 10-year horizon. Methods As per previous modelling work, we used a multistate life table model with 16 tobacco-related diseases in parallel, parameterised with rich national data by sex, age and ethnicity. The intervention modelled was 10% annual increases in tobacco tax from 2011 to 2020 in the New Zealand population (n=4.4 million in 2011). The perspective was that of the health system, and the discount rate used was 3%. Results For this 10-year time horizon, the total health gain from the tobacco tax in discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the 20–65 year age group (age at QALY accrual) was 180 QALYs or 1.6% of the lifetime QALYs gained in this age group (11 300 QALYs). Nevertheless, for this short time horizon: (1) cost savings in this group amounted to NZ$10.6 million (equivalent to US$7.1 million; 95% uncertainty interval: NZ$6.0 million to NZ$17.7 million); and (2) around two-thirds of the QALY gains for all ages occurred in the 20–65 year age group. Focusing on just the preretirement and postretirement ages, the QALY gains in each of the 60–64 and 65–69 year olds were 11.5% and 10.6%, respectively, of the 268 total QALYs gained for all age groups in 2011–2020. Conclusions The majority of the health benefit over a 10-year horizon from increasing tobacco taxes is accrued in the working-age population (20–65 years). There remains a need for more work on the associated productivity benefits of such health gains. ","Only a small proportion, approximately 0.7%, of the total health gains over the remaining lifetimes of the New Zealand population occur in the first 10 years after the tax interventions start. The majority (67.4%) of the health gains in the first 10 years after the start of a programme of 10% per annum increases in tobacco tax accrue in working-age adults, those aged 20–65. Despite the small health gain in this initial 10-year time period, the intervention is still cost saving (NZ$14.5 million) within this 10-year time horizon. Health gains in each of the 60–64 (preretirement ages) and 65–69 (postretirement ages) year olds were 11.5% and 10.6%, respectively, of the total health gains for all age groups in 2011–2020.

Tobacco Control,2019,"Availability, price and promotions for cigarettes and non-cigarette tobacco products: an observational comparison of US Air Force bases with nearby tobacco retailers, 2016",Research Article,['gender'],"Introduction Active duty military personnel have higher cigarette and smokeless tobacco use rates than civilian populations. Although US Airmen (called Airmen regardless of gender or rank) are required to be tobacco-free during initial training, many resume use once this period ends, perhaps as a result of easy access to cheap tobacco products. Methods Between July and September 2016, we collected tobacco product, price and promotion information by visiting on-base (n=28) and off-base (n=80) tobacco retailers near the eight technical training bases where approximately 99% of Airmen attend training. We conducted mixed linear effects models to examine on-base versus off-base differences. Results Cigarette packs were 11%–12% cheaper at on-base retailers compared with off-base retailers. Newport Menthol and Marlboro Red cigarette packs were $0.87 and $0.80 lower on-base (p<0.001) while the cheapest pack available was $0.54 lower on-base (p<0.01). Copenhagen smokeless tobacco was also significantly cheaper on-base (B=−0.65, p<0.01). Interior price promotions were more common on-base. Conclusions Retail stores located on Air Force bases sell cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products at prices well below those in nearby off-base retailers: the vast majority of these retailers feature interior price promotions for these products. Federal policies regulating prices of on-base tobacco sales, if implemented more effectively, have the potential to protect the health of Airmen by helping them remain tobacco-free after technical training. ","This study is the first to assess disparities in both the pricing and availability of multiple tobacco products on-base and off-base. We also demonstrate the feasibility of conducting in-person tobacco retailer assessments at multiple tobacco retailer store types. Similar to previous studies, we document lower prices for premium cigarette brands for on-base retailers, and on-base stores sell packs and cartons of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco for less than neighbouring retailers. Compared with off-base stores, on-base stores are also more likely to display interior price promotions for cigarettes and smokeless products, two products that are most widely used by Airmen.

Tobacco Control,2019,Impact of removing point-of-sale tobacco displays on smoking behaviour among adolescents in Europe: a quasi-experimental study,Other,['gender'],"Background An increasing number of European countries implemented a point-of-sale (PoS) display ban on tobacco products. This study assessed the association between PoS display bans in Europe and adolescent smoking and perceived accessibility of tobacco, 2–6 years after PoS display ban implementation. Methods In a quasi-experimental design, we compared individuals in countries that did and countries that did not implement a PoS display ban, before and after implementation. We used repeated cross-sectional data of 174 878 15-year-old and 16-year-old adolescents from 25 countries from the 2007, 2011 and 2015 European Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs surveys. Multilevel logistic regression models examined smoking behaviour (regular smoking vs other) and perceived access (easy vs difficult) as a function of display ban implementation and controlled for survey year, gender, parental education and implementation of other tobacco control policies. Interaction with gender was tested. Results The implementation of a PoS display ban was associated with a 15% larger drop in the odds of regular smoking (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91), but was not significantly associated with perceived accessibility of tobacco (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.892 to 1.03). Associations were similar in males and females (cross-level interactions of gender with display ban were not statistically significant for either outcome). Conclusion The implementation of PoS display bans in Europe was associated with a stronger decrease in regular smoking among adolescents. This decrease does not appear to be driven by a decreasing accessibility of tobacco, but might be caused by further de-normalisation of tobacco as a result of PoS display bans. ","Tobacco displays at the point of sale remain an important marketing tool for the tobacco industry in Europe. Some studies suggest that the removal of point-of-sale tobacco displays contributed to the de-normalisation of smoking among adolescents. Evidence on the impact of tobacco display bans on actual adolescent smoking behaviour is lacking. Studies to date have been restricted to single countries, which do not take secular trends into account. This is the first international quasi-experimental study to provide evidence on the effect of point-of-sale tobacco display bans on adolescent smoking. The implementation of a display ban was associated with a 15% stronger decline in the odds of adolescent smoking than when no display ban had been implemented. This decrease in smoking does not appear to be driven by a decreasing perceived accessibility of tobacco. The implementation of point-of-sale display bans throughout Europe could contribute to a substantial further decline in adolescent smoking.

AC, 151 (females 44.4%) and Quit.ie, 149 (females 45.6%), mean age 44 years. outcomes for all 300 were analysed (intention-to-treat). Recruited through advertisement from July 2015 to February 2016. Intervention Randomly assigned to AC (n=151) and Quit.ie (n=149), matched for age, sex and education. Block randomisation, enrolment and follow-up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Primary aim was to determine if AC had higher quit rates than Quit.ie service at 3 months. Secondary aims: quit rates at 1, 6 and 12 months and analysis of associated factors including weight. AC consisted of a 5-hour seminar, in a group setting. Quit.ie is an online portal for smoking cessation. Results AC had higher quit rates at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. AC: 38%, (n=57), 27% (n=40), 23% (n=35), 22% (n=33) vs Quit.ie: 20% (n=30), 15% (n=22), 15% (n=23), 11% (n=17), respectively (all p values <0.05).

Conclusions All AC quit rates were superior to Quit.ie, outcomes were comparable with established interventions. Trial registration number ISRCTN12951013. Recruitment July 2015–February 2016. ","The Allen Carr book is said to have sold some 13 million copies and have helped people stop smoking. There are a large number of celebrity endorsements testifying to the merits of Allen Carr’s method but very few trials of any kind and very few publications of outcomes. No randomised clinical trials of Allen Carr’s Easyway to Stop Smoking were published before this trial. This study shows that Allen Carr’s Easyway to Stop Smoking was superior to a standard online National Smoking Cessation in a Randomised Clinical Trial. It was free of any serious side effects. As a once-off seminar, where pharmacotherapy is not used, it seems highly appropriate to consider it as an acceptable method for smoking cessation.

Tobacco Control,2019,Exposure to tobacco in video games and smoking among gamers in Argentina,Other,['sex'],"Background Our objective was to assess whether exposure to tobacco in video games is associated with smoking among adolescent gamers from Argentina. Methods Cross-sectional data were analysed from students in public and private middle schools in Argentina. Tobacco content in video games was estimated using previously validated methods and adolescents’ tobacco exposure was assessed by multiplying tobacco content in the top three video games they play by the hours played per day. The primary outcome was current smoking. Multilevel logistic regression models adjusted for clustering within schools, regressing current smoking on tobacco exposure in video games (ie, none, low, high) after controlling for age, sex, parental education, parenting style, parental rules about the use of video games, rebelliousness, sensation seeking and ‘technophilia’. Results Of the 3114 students who participated, 92% of boys (1685/1802) and 56% of girls (737/1312) played video games and were included in the analytical sample. The prevalence of smoking was 13.8% among boys and 22.0% among girls; 74.5% of boys played video games more than 1 hour per day compared with 47.7% of girls. High exposure to tobacco content in video games compared with no exposure was independently associated with current smoking among girls (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.09) but not among boys (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.51). Conclusions Greater exposure to tobacco content in video games was associated with higher likelihood of smoking among Argentine girls who play video games, suggesting the need for policies that limit these exposures. ","Many studies have found a relationship between tobacco content in movies and youth smoking. Video games are played by most adolescents, yet only one study has assessed the association between tobacco exposure in video games and smoking. Only one prior study has examined the association between tobacco exposure in video games and tobacco consumption among youth. Differential effects of such exposures by sex have not been studied even though boys and girls differ in the amount and types of games that they play. This study used a novel approach to measure tobacco exposure in video games. Greater exposure to tobacco in video games was independently associated with higher likelihood of smoking among girls but not boys who play video games, suggesting that the effects of video games on risk behaviours may differ by sex.

Tobacco Control,2019,"Plain packaging: legislative differences in Australia, France, the UK, New Zealand and Norway, and options for strengthening regulations",Other,['straight'],"By July 2018, five countries (Australia, France, the UK, New Zealand and Norway) had fully implemented plain (standardised) packaging. Using government documents, we reviewed the key legislative differences between these five countries to identify best practice measures and potential lacuna. We then discuss how governments planning to introduce plain packaging could strengthen their legislation. Differences between countries include the terminology used (either ‘plain’, ‘standardised’ or ‘plain and standardised’), products covered and transition times (ranging from 2 to 12 months). Myriad differences exist with respect to the packaging, including the dimensions (explicitly stated for height, width and depth vs minimum dimensions for the health warnings only), structure (straight-edged flip-top packs vs straight, rounded and bevelled-edged flip-top packs and shoulder boxes) and size (minimum number of cigarettes and weight of tobacco vs fixed amounts) and warning content (eg, inclusion of a stop-smoking web address and/or quitline displayed on warnings on one or both principal display areas). Future options that merit further analysis include banning colour descriptors in brand and variant names, allowing pack inserts promoting cessation and permitting cigarettes that are designed to be dissuasive. Plain packaging legislation and regulations are divergent. Countries moving towards plain packaging should consider incorporating the strengths of existing policies and review opportunities for extending these. While plain packaging represents a milestone in tobacco-control policy, future legislation need not simply reflect the past but could set new benchmarks to maximise the potential benefits of this policy. ","By July 2018, five countries (Australia, France, the UK, New Zealand and Norway) had fully implemented plain tobacco packaging. We explored the legislative differences between these countries. Non-packaging differences included the terminology used, tobacco products covered and transition times. Differences with respect to the packaging included the pack dimensions, structure and size, and display of the health warnings. Existing legislation could be strengthened by banning or more strictly controlling variant name, and allowing for health-promoting pack inserts and dissuasive cigarettes.

Tobacco Control,2019,"Restricting tobacco sales to only pharmacies combined with cessation advice: a modelling study of the future smoking prevalence, health and cost impacts",Research Article,['sex'],"Objective Restricting tobacco sales to pharmacies only, including the provision of cessation advice, has been suggested as a potential measure to hasten progress towards the tobacco endgame. We aimed to quantify the impacts of this hypothetical intervention package on future smoking prevalence, population health and health system costs for a country with an endgame goal: New Zealand (NZ). Methods We used two peer-reviewed simulation models: 1) a dynamic population forecasting model for smoking prevalence and 2) a closed cohort multi-state life-table model for future health gains and costs by sex, age and ethnicity. Greater costs due to increased travel distances to purchase tobacco were treated as an increase in the price of tobacco. Annual cessation rates were multiplied with the effect size for brief opportunistic cessation advice on sustained smoking abstinence. Results The intervention package was associated with a reduction in future smoking prevalence, such that by 2025 prevalence was 17.3%/6.8% for Māori (Indigenous)/non-Māori compared to 20.5%/8.1% projected under no intervention. The measure was furthermore estimated to accrue 41 700 discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 33 500 to 51 600) over the remainder of the 2011 NZ population’s lives. Of these QALYs gained, 74% were due to the provision of cessation advice over and above the limiting of sales to pharmacies. Conclusions This work provides modelling-level evidence that the package of restricting tobacco sales to only pharmacies combined with cessation advice in these settings can accelerate progress towards the tobacco endgame, and achieve large population health benefits and cost-savings. ⇓ ","Substantially changing the tobacco retail landscape has been suggested as one way to accelerate progress in countries adopting tobacco endgame goals. One option would be to restrict tobacco sales to pharmacies only, but there is still limited evidence for the effectiveness of such an intervention and it has never been modelled. This is the first study attempting to quantify the impact of an intervention package of restricting tobacco sales to pharmacies along with the provision of brief smoking cessation advice in these settings. It did so in a country with rich epidemiological and health costing data: New Zealand. This intervention package was estimated to result in additional reductions in smoking prevalence, sizeable health gains and large cost-savings to the health system.

Tobacco Control,2019,"Evolving IQOS packaging designs change perceptions of product appeal, uniqueness, quality and safety: a randomised experiment, 2018, USA",Brief Report,"['gender', 'sexual orientation']","Background Globally, the tobacco industry is promoting heated tobacco products. These products may represent a strategy to promote dual use of tobacco products. One product, IQOS from Philip Morris International, is being proposed in the USA for marketing as a less harmful product. The visual design of tobacco products can influence consumers by implying product characteristics. Thus, we sought to test the impact of IQOS packaging designs on cognitive, affective and behavioural intention responses. Methods From existing IQOS packages used globally, we developed three IQOS packages that decreasingly linked the product to the Marlboro brand. In September to October 2018, we assigned participants randomly to one package in an online experiment. All participants (n=954) were US adults reporting current smoking and no colour blindness. The experiment used quota sampling to ensure diversity by gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity and education. Measures were informed by the Context of Consumption Framework. To assess differences in ratings, we conducted non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests with post hoc comparisons using Dunn’s test. Results We found significant differences in cognitive indicators including appeal (H=6.87, p=0.03), uniqueness (H=15.68, p<0.01), brand equity–quality (H=122.35, p<0.01) and perceived safety compared with other tobacco products (H=14.27, p<0.01). Participants rated packages similarly on affective and behavioural intention measures. All were rated low for talking to others about the product and high for interest in trying with a coupon. Conclusion Linking or separating IQOS products with a well-established cigarette brand changes how adult smokers respond to the product. Regulators should consider the visual design of packaging. ","Tobacco product packaging influences consumer behaviors. The tobacco industry has used the visual design of products to evade restrictions on marketing products as less harmful. New heated tobacco products (e.g., IQOS) are entering the market and their regulation is still evolving. Evidence regarding how to regulate the visual design of heated tobacco products is lacking. IQOS packaging used globally can result in different perceptions of the product, including changes to perceptions of harm. Even in the absence of explicit claims of less harmful product, product packaging can change perceptions of harms from IQOS.

Tobacco Control,2019,Individualised tobacco affordability in the UK 2002–2014: findings from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project,Research Article,['sex'],"Objective The existing measures of tobacco affordability (smokers' purchasing power for tobacco) use national estimates of income and average cigarette prices, and exclude roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco. This study developed an individualised measure of tobacco affordability using smokers' own incomes and factory-made (FM) or RYO tobacco purchase prices, and explored how it was impacted by taxation changes, individual characteristics and purchase patterns. Design Cross-sectional survey data collated from 10 waves of a longitudinal cohort study. Data sources Adult smokers (n=4062) from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project United Kingdom (UK), surveyed between 2002 and 2014, providing 8943 observations over 10 surveys. Analysis Affordability was calculated as the percentage of annual income remaining with the individuals after their annual tobacco expenditure. Multilevel linear regression models were used with affordability as the outcome using time, sex, age, geographical region, ethnicity, education, nicotine dependence and tobacco purchase source as the predictor variables. Results Affordability of FM cigarettes decreased significantly from 91.5% (±95% CI: 91.0% to 91.9%) in 2002 to 87.8% (87.0% to 88.5%) in 2014; and RYO from 96.3% (95.7% to 96.9%) in 2006 to 93.7% (93.0% to 94.4%) in 2014. Affordability was significantly lower for FM than RYO. Year-on-year decreases were not statistically significant. Tobacco was more affordable for males, those with higher education, less dependent smokers and those purchasing from non-store (potentially illicit) or non-UK sources. Conclusions An individualised measure of tobacco affordability provided useful insights on the impact of tobacco taxes, social inequalities and purchase patterns in the UK. Although tobacco became less affordable, the annual rate of decline was low, suggesting annual tax rises were not large enough. ","Raising cigarette prices through tobacco taxation is an effective tobacco control measure, but it is impacted by inflation rates and changes in income. Affordability measures have been developed to enable these considerations to be taken into account and such measures have been standardised to enable comparisons over time and across countries. Extant measures use national income estimates and average cigarette prices of Marlboro or local brands. Aggregate affordability measures can be problematic given wide income inequalities and the range of prices across brands and different types of tobacco (such as factory made (FM) and roll-your-own (RYO). In addition they cannot account for smokers ‘strategies to minimise costs, such as buying in bulk or from cheaper sources. This study developed a complementary individualised measure of tobacco affordability using smokers' own incomes and FM and (for the first time) RYO tobacco purchase prices. Both FM and RYO became less affordable over time, but RYO was significantly more affordable than FM and the annual rate of decline in individualised affordability was low, suggesting annual tax rises were not large enough. Individual characteristics and purchasing decisions influenced tobacco affordability.

Tobacco Control,2020,"Age of tobacco use initiation and association with current use and nicotine dependence among US middle and high school students, 2014–2016",Research Article,['sex'],"Introduction Tobacco use mostly begins in adolescence and young adulthood. Earlier age of initiation of cigarette smoking is associated with greater nicotine dependence and sustained tobacco use. However, data are limited on the age of initiation of non-cigarette tobacco products, and the association between using these products and nicotine dependence and progression to established use. Methods Combined 2014–2016 National Youth Tobacco Survey data, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of US students in grades 6–12 yielded 19 580 respondents who reported ever using any of five tobacco products: electronic cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco and hookah. Analyses assessed age of reported first use of each product among ever-users, overall and by sex and race/ethnicity. Current daily use, past 30-day use, feelings of craving tobacco and time to first tobacco use after waking were assessed by age of first use. Results Among ever-users, weighted median age for first use was 12.6 years for cigarettes, 13.8 years for cigars, 13.4 years for smokeless tobacco, 14.1 years for hookah and 14.1 years for e-cigarettes. First trying these tobacco products at age ≤13 years was associated with greater current use of the respective product and nicotine dependence compared with initiating use at age >13 years. Conclusions First tobacco use at age ≤13 years is associated with current daily and past 30-day use of non-cigarette tobacco products, and with the development of nicotine dependence among youth ever-users. Proven tobacco prevention interventions that reach early adolescents are important to reduce overall youth tobacco use. ","Tobacco use and nicotine addiction usually begin in adolescence and young adulthood; earlier age of smoking initiation is associated with establishing daily smoking and nicotine dependence. In 2017, 1 in 5 US high school students and 1 in 16 middle school students reported using a tobacco product on at least 1 day in the past 30 days, including non-cigarette products such as electronic cigarettes, hookah, smokeless tobacco and cigars. Data on the age of initiation of non-cigarette tobacco products among US adolescents are limited to reported mean age of electronic cigarette initiation and its association with subsequent initiation of cigarette smoking. Adolescents who use e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco and hookah initiate the use of these products between ages 13–14 years, on average, versus 12.6 years for cigarettes. Up to three quarters of youth ever-users of e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco and hookah reported first trying the products before age 16 years. First trying tobacco products at age 13 years or younger, compared with first trying at 14 years or older, was associated with greater current use of the respective product; and two major symptoms of nicotine dependence: tobacco cravings and using tobacco within 30 min of waking up in the morning.

Tobacco Control,2020,Estimating the long-run relationship between state cigarette taxes and county life expectancy,Research Article,['sex'],"Introduction While a large body of literature suggests that tobacco control legislation—including fiscal measures such as excise taxes—effectively reduces tobacco smoking, the long-run (10+ years) relationship between cigarettes excise taxes and life expectancy has not been directly evaluated. Here, we test the hypothesis that increases in state cigarette excise taxes are positively associated with long-run increases in population-level life expectancy. Methods We studied age-standardised life expectancy among all US counties from 1996 to 2012 by sex, in relation to state cigarette excise tax rates by year, controlling for other demographic, socioeconomic and county-specific features. We used an error-correction model to assess the long-run relationship between taxes and life expectancy. We additionally examine whether the relationship between cigarette taxes and life expectancy was mediated by changes to county smoking prevalence and varied by the sex, income and rural/urban composition of a county. Results For every one-dollar increase in cigarette tax per pack (in 2016 dollars), county life expectancy increased by 1 year (95% CI 0.60 to 1.40 years) over the long run, with the first 6-month increase in life expectancy taking 10 years to materialise. The association was mediated by changes in smoking prevalence and the magnitude of the association steadily increased as county income decreased. Conclusions Results suggest that increasing cigarette excise tax rates translates to consequential population-level improvements in life expectancy, with larger effects in low-income counties. ","A large body of literature suggests that tobacco control legislation—including fiscal measures such as excise taxes—effectively reduces tobacco smoking. The long-run (10+ years) relationship between cigarette taxes and life expectancy has not been directly evaluated. We find that a one-dollar increase in cigarette tax per pack (in 2016 dollars) translated to an increase in life expectancy of 1 year over the following decades, with the first 6-month increase in life expectancy taking 10 years to materialise. There was a larger life-expectancy benefit of increases in cigarette excise taxes in lower-income counties compared with higher-income counties, which is evidence against the claim that cigarette taxes are regressive.

Tobacco Control,2020,"Awareness and interest in IQOS heated tobacco products among youth in Canada, England and the USA",Research Article,['sex'],"Introduction Heated tobacco products (HTPs), such as IQOS, have been introduced in a growing number of international markets. However, little is known about perceptions of HTP products among youth. Methods Data are from wave 1 of the International Tobacco Control Youth Tobacco and E-cigarette Survey (2017), a web-based cohort survey of people aged 16–19 years from Canada, England and the USA. Respondents (n=12 064) were shown an image of IQOS and asked about their awareness, interest in trying and susceptibility to trying the product. Youth awareness, interest in trying and susceptibility to trying IQOS were analysed using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression models were used to examine correlates of these outcomes. Results Overall, 7.0% of youth reported awareness of IQOS (England=5.6%, Canada=6.4% and USA=9.1%) and 38.6% expressed interest in trying the product (England=41.8%, Canada=33.0% and USA=40.9%). Within each country, all key outcomes varied by smoking status: greater proportions of youth who were currently smoking or had a history of smoking reported being aware of, interested in trying and susceptible to trying IQOS. Interest and susceptibility to trying IQOS were associated with male sex, current tobacco use and current e-cigarette use. Across all countries, susceptibility to trying IQOS (25.1%) was higher than for tobacco cigarettes (19.3%), but lower than for e-cigarettes (29.1%). Conclusions Awareness of HTPs, such as IQOS, is emerging among youth in Canada, England and the USA. Interest in trying these products is very high among smokers, but also present among non-smokers. ","To date, there is little or no data on perceptions or use of heated tobacco products (HTPs) among youth, including youth smokers and non-smokers. Findings from the current study show that youth awareness of HTPs is emerging in Western countries. Interest in trying these products is very high among smokers, but also present among non-smokers. The findings are directly relevant to policy, given that youth appeal of HTPs represents a fundamental component of evaluating their public health impact.

Tobacco Control,2020,A comparison of methods to measure daily cigarillo consumption among adolescents and young adults,Research Article,['gender'],"Objective Cigarillo use is widespread among young people. Accurate assessment of cigarillo consumption is necessary to inform and evaluate tobacco research, but is complicated by product sharing and irregular use. This study compares a conventional approach with a detailed approach for measuring cigarillo consumption. Methods Data are drawn from a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 1089 young (aged 15–28 years) cigarillo smokers. The conventional measure of cigarillo consumption employs two common tobacco use items—the number of days a product was smoked in the past month and the average number of products smoked per day. The detailed measure uses a time line follow-back procedure to assess product use on each of the past 7 days, both in a group and alone. Paired t-tests compare daily cigarillo use estimates from the two methods overall, and are stratified by sample characteristics and behaviours; associations with multiple factors are examined simultaneously using linear regression. Results Compared with the conventional measure, the detailed measure yields significantly higher daily consumption estimates for moderate and high-level users and for non-daily tobacco users, and significantly lower estimates for those who always share products and daily tobacco users. Differences remain after controlling for demographics and product use behaviours. There are no differences by gender, age, race or multiple product use. Conclusions The two measurement methods yield significantly different consumption estimates based on sharing behaviour, regularity of use and use level. Improving accuracy in the measurement of tobacco product consumption is important and timely for tobacco control research and policy. ","Accuracy in measuring tobacco consumption is important to research and policy efforts, such as measuring associations with nicotine dependence and evaluating the effectiveness of cessation treatment. Cigarillo smokers demonstrate unique use patterns, including product sharing and irregular use. These factors may compromise the accuracy of cigarillo consumption estimates derived using the conventional method of measuring tobacco use. Our study found that a detailed, time line follow-back method of measurement yielded significantly higher daily consumption estimates for non-daily tobacco users and moderate and high-level users, and significantly lower estimates for those who share products and daily tobacco users. Tobacco control initiatives may benefit from considering population and subgroup characteristics when determining tobacco measurement methods among cigarillo users.

Tobacco Control,2020,"Hardening or softening? An observational study of changes to the prevalence of hardening indicators in Victoria, Australia, 2001–2016",Research Article,['sex'],"Background The hardening hypothesis predicts that as smoking prevalence declines, remaining smokers will be more heavily addicted to nicotine and/or less interested in quitting. We tested this hypothesis in a population exposed to a comprehensive tobacco control programme over a 16-year period. Methods Annual cross-sectional surveys randomly sampled adults (aged 26+) in the state of Victoria, Australia, between 2001 and 2016. Until 2010, participants were recruited through random digit dialling to landline telephones; from 2011, sampling frames also included mobile phones. Logistic regressions assessed changes over time in the prevalence of smoking and each hardening indicator; additional models examined interactions by sex, age, education and socioeconomic status. Results Smoking prevalence declined significantly between 2001 and 2016 (20.1%–13.0%), as did the prevalence of seven hardening indicators: daily smoking, heavy consumption, no quit attempt in the past 5 years or past 12 months, no intention to quit in the next 6 months or next 30 days, and happiness to keep smoking. In addition, the proportion of smokers defined as ‘hardcore’ decreased from 17.2% to 9.1%. On the whole, hardening indicators decreased to a similar extent among demographic subgroups. Conclusions These results are inconsistent with the hardening hypothesis. Rather, they suggest that a comprehensive tobacco control programme that combines provision of cessation support to individual smokers with implementation of population-level interventions to drive all smokers towards quitting, can successfully reduce both smoking prevalence and levels of dependence and desire to keep smoking among the remaining population of smokers. ","Evidence from the USA, Europe, New Zealand and Australia tends not to support the hardening hypothesis, observing decreases rather than increases in the proportion of hardcore smokers as smoking prevalence declines. However, some studies suggest that while the overall proportion of hardcore smokers is not increasing, the remaining smoking population may be increasingly composed of subgroups who experience greater difficulty in quitting. The current study tested the hardening hypothesis among smokers in the Australian state of Victoria, and extended previous work by examining changes in multiple hardening indicators over an extended 16-year period, among demographic subgroups as well as the overall population. Contrary to the hardening hypothesis, as the prevalence of smoking in Victoria declined so did the prevalence of hardcore smokers and eight of nine hardening indicators. On the whole, these trends did not differ by sex, age, education or socioeconomic status. The comprehensive tobacco control programme implemented in Victoria since 2001 appears to have been successful in reducing smoking prevalence as well as dampening the desire to keep smoking among the remaining population of smokers.

Tobacco Control,2020,"Disparities in current cigarette smoking among US adults, 2002–2016",Research Article,['sex'],"Background To assess disparities in current (past 30 days) cigarette smoking among US adults aged ≥ 18 years during 2002–2016. Methods Nine indicators associated with social disadvantage were analysed from the 2002 to 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: education, annual family income, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, serious psychological distress, health insurance, public assistance, and employment status. Using descriptive and multivariable analyses, we measured trends in smoking overall and within the assessed variables. We also evaluated effect of interactions on disparities and estimated the excess number of smokers attributable to disparities. Results During 2002–2016, current cigarette smoking prevalence declined overall (27.5%–20.7%; p trend < 0.01), and among all subgroups except Medicare insurees and American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). Overall inequalities in cigarette smoking grew even wider or remained unchanged for several indicators during the study period. In 2016, comparing groups with the least versus the most social advantage, the single largest disparity in current smoking prevalence was seen by race/ethnicity (prevalence ratio = 5.1, AI/ANs vs Asians). Education differences alone explained 38.0% of the observed racial/ethnic disparity in smoking prevalence. Interactions were also present; compared with the population-averaged prevalence among all AI/AN individuals (34.0%), prevalence was much higher among AI/ANs with <high school diploma (53.0%), unemployed (58.0%), or with serious psychological distress (66.9%). The burden of smoking attributable to race/ethnic disparities in smoking prevalence was an estimated 27.6 million smokers. Conclusions Overall smoking inequality increased or remained unchanged because of slower declines in smoking prevalence among disadvantaged groups. Targeted interventions among high-risk groups can narrow disparities. ","Reduction in cigarette smoking prevalence has occurred over the past 20–30 years. With the fast evolving tobacco control landscape, historical trends are needed to understand within-group and overall inequalities in smoking. We conducted a comprehensive examination of pair-wise and overall inequalities across multiple sociodemographic indicators of policy, historical, clinical, and social significance over 15 years. Data were from the 2002 to 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health for adults aged 18+ years. During 2002–2016, current cigarette smoking prevalence declined overall (27.5%–20.7%; p trend < 0.01), and among all subgroups except Medicare insurees and American Indians /Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). Several socioeconomic indicators modified the relationship between race/ethnicity and smoking. Compared to the population-averaged prevalence among all AI/AN individuals (34.0%), prevalence was much higher among AI/ANs with < high school diploma (53.0%), unemployed (58.0%) or with serious psychological distress (66.9%). The burden of smoking attributable to race/ethnic disparities in smoking was an estimated 27.56 million smokers.

Tobacco Control,2020,Heated tobacco products use in Chinese adults in Hong Kong: a population-based cross-sectional study,Research Article,['sex'],"Introduction We investigated heated tobacco products (HTPs) use and associated factors in Chinese adults in Hong Kong where HTPs are not formally marketed yet, and cigarette smoking prevalence was the lowest in the developed world. Methods A population-based landline telephone survey in 2017 interviewed 5131 (45.2% male; 26.7% aged ≥60) adults to collect information on awareness, intention to use, ever use of HTPs, cigarette smoking status and sociodemographic characteristics. Descriptive statistics were weighted by the age, sex and smoking status of the Hong Kong adult population. Sociodemographics were mutually adjusted in logistic regression to yield adjusted ORs (AORs) for awareness of HTPs, controlling for smoking status. Results Overall, 11.3% (95% CI 10.0% to 12.7%) were aware of HTPs and 1.0 % (0.8%–1.2%) had ever used it. Awareness was associated with aged 40–49 years (AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87) or 30–39 years (2.03, 1.41–2.91) (vs ≥60 years), born in Hong Kong (1.37, 1.11–1.68) and higher monthly household income (p for trend 0.001). Ever HTP users had higher educational attainment and monthly household income, and more were aged 30–39 and economically active (all p<0.003). In never HTP users, intention to use HTPs (7.3%, 4.9%–10.8%) were more prevalent in respondents with similar characteristics (all p<0.008). More current (vs never) smokers were aware of HTPs, intent to use HTPs and had ever used HTPs (all p<0.001). Conclusion Higher socioeconomic status was associated with HTP use and intention to use. Public health education on HTPs is needed especially for this high-risk group. ",Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are promoted as healthier than combustible cigarettes and emerging worldwide. Reports on the prevalence of use and risk factors in countries where they have launched are increasing. Little is known about the prevalence of HTP use and risk factors in countries where HTPs are not yet legally marketed and widely available. HTP use is associated with higher socioeconomic status in Hong Kong where the prevalence of conventional cigarette smoking is low. ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054719,Yongda Socrates Wu; Man Ping Wang; Sai Yin Ho; Ho Cheung William LI; Yee Tak Derek Cheung; Takahiro Tabuchi; Antonio CS Kwong; Vienna Lai; Tai Hing Lam; ,School of Nursing; The University of Hong Kong; School of Nursing; The University of Hong Kong; School of Public Health; The University of Hong Kong; School of Nursing; The University of Hong Kong; School of Nursing; The University of Hong Kong; Center for Cancer Control and Statistics; Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases; Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health; Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health; School of Public Health; The University of Hong Kong;

Deaths from HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men was obtained from the California Department of Public Health. Future deaths from smoking and HIV/AIDS were projected using regression equations based on time trends. Results From 2005 to 2014, smoking caused over 6800 deaths among gay and bisexual men, while nearly 9500 died from HIV/AIDS. Mortality from both causes has been falling, but deaths from HIV/AIDS have been falling more rapidly. Projections suggest that in the mid-2040s, more gay/bisexual men will die from smoking than from HIV/AIDS. Conclusion Smoking will surpass HIV/AIDS as a cause of death among gay and bisexual men in California within a few decades. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community was highly effective in drawing attention and resources to the fight against HIV/AIDS, saving untold lives by hastening effective treatments. Lessons learnt in the fight against AIDS should be used to help fight the tobacco epidemic. ","One in five deaths in the USA is attributable to smoking. Gay and bisexual men smoke at higher rates than heterosexual men, suggesting that many of them may be victims of smoking-attributable mortality. The mortality toll of cigarette smoking on the gay and bisexual community has not been studied. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, which mobilised effectively against the AIDS epidemic, has largely ignored the tobacco epidemic. We found that smoking-attributable deaths will exceed deaths from AIDS in the California gay/bisexual community within a few decades. The LGBT community could build on its successful organising against AIDS to help diminish the toll of tobacco.

Tobacco Control,2020,"Active smoking, secondhand smoke exposure and serum cotinine levels among Cheyenne River Sioux communities in context of a Tribal Public Health Policy",Research Article,['gender'],"Introduction American Indians and Alaska Natives face disproportionately high rates of smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (CRST) is among the few Tribal Nations controlling commercial tobacco exposures in public and work places. We had an opportunity to explore effects of the new commercial tobacco-free policy (implemented in 2015) in an environmental health study (2014–2016) that collected information about commercial tobacco use and SHS prevalence and examined predictor variables of serum cotinine concentrations. Methods Self-reported survey data were used in quantile regression statistical modelling to explore changes in cotinine levels, based on smoking status, smokeless tobacco consumption and SHS exposure. Results From enrolled 225 adults, 51% (N=114) were current smokers. Among 88 non-tobacco users, 35 (40%) reported current SHS exposure. Significant differences in cotinine median concentrations were found among participants with and without current SHS exposure. Extremely high cotinine concentrations (~100 times larger than the median) were detected in some non-tobacco users. After implementing the new smoke-free air Tribal policy, cotinine decreased in participants with intermediate (3–15 ng/mL, non-tobacco users with SHS exposure) and high (>15 ng/mL, mainly tobacco users) cotinine levels showing association with an abatement of opportunities for SHS exposure. Significant predictors of cotinine levels were sampling year, current smoking and tobacco chewing. No gender differences were observed in cotinine. Conclusions Our results show decrease in cotinine concentrations in CRST participants since implementation of their ‘Smoke-Free Clean Air Act’ in 2015. ","This is the first study to our knowledge that demonstrates the importance and immediate impact of a smoke-free Tribal policy on serum cotinine levels in a high-risk, high tobacco consuming American Indian community. We confirm the effectiveness of using serum cotinine levels in the context of a Tribal tobacco control policy. Decrease in secondhand smoke exposures shortly after enacting the Tribal tobacco control policy can be detected. This result supports the protection of a Sovereign Nations’ comprehensive smoke-free law. ",http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055056,Elena R. O'Donald; Curtis P.

Tobacco Control,2020,Tobacco 21 policies in California and Hawaii and sales of cigarette packs: a difference-in-differences analysis,Brief Report,['sex'],"Objective To measure the association of raising the minimum legal age of tobacco sales to 21 years (T21) statewide with monthly sales of cigarette packs in California and Hawaii, the first two states to implement T21 statewide. Methods State monthly cigarette tax revenues from state departments of taxation were analysed for 11 states from January 2014 through December 2018 (n=660). Monthly cigarette packs sold were constructed using cigarette tax revenue and cigarette tax rate in each state. A difference-in-differences regression method was used to estimate the association of statewide T21 policies with monthly cigarette packs sold in California and Hawaii, separately, compared to the western states that did not implement such policies. Both models were controlled for year–month fixed effects, cigarette tax rates, smoke-free air laws, Medicaid coverage of smoking cessation, minimum legal sales ages for e-cigarettes and state marijuana laws, in addition to state demographic characteristics (sex, age, education, race/ethnicity and population size). Findings Implementation of T21 statewide was associated with a reduction of 9.41 (95% CI=–15.52 to –3.30) million monthly packs sold in California and 0.57 (95% CI=–0.83 to –0.30) million monthly packs sold in Hawaii, compared to regional states. These translate to a reduction of 13.1%–18.2%, respectively, in monthly packs sold relative to mean values before the implementation of T21. Conclusions Raising the minimum legal age for tobacco sales to 21 years could reduce cigarette sales as part of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy that complements and builds on proven approaches to achieve this goal. ","Previous studies evaluating Tobacco 21 policies are limited to local jurisdictions and have shown mixed findings. This is the first study to measure the association of statewide Tobacco 21 policies with cigarette sales in California and Hawaii, the first two states to implement such policies statewide. This study found that implementation of Tobacco 21 policies statewide was associated with a reduction of 13.1%– 18.2% in cigarette sales in California and Hawaii, respectively, compared to the western states that did not implement such policies. These findings indicate that raising the minimum legal age for tobacco sales to 21 years statewide is a promising public health intervention for reducing cigarette sales and consumption.

Tobacco Control,2020,Exposure to tobacco marketing in bars predicts subsequent use of multiple tobacco products among non-tobacco-using college students,Research Article,['sex'],"Background Due to other marketing restrictions, one venue where tobacco companies concentrate their marketing efforts to reach young adults is bars/nightclubs. Objective This study examined the relationship between exposure to tobacco marketing in bars/nightclubs and number of alternative tobacco/nicotine products used 6 months later among college students. Methods Participants were 1,406 students aged 18–29 years old who reported going to bars or nightclubs at least rarely (M age=21.95; 67% female; 46% non-Hispanic white). Students completed an online survey in fall 2014/spring 2015 (wave 1) and again 6 months later (wave 2). Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to assess the relationship between exposure to three types of marketing at bars/nightclubs at wave 1 (tobacco/nicotine product advertisements; free samples; industry representatives) and number of tobacco products used (range=0–5) at wave 2, controlling for school type (2 year vs 4 year), age, sex, race/ethnicity and frequency of bar visits. An interaction between the number of wave 1 products and each marketing variable was tested. Results Greater exposure to free samples and tobacco industry representatives at bars/nightclubs predicted a greater number of products used 6 months later, but only among wave 1 non-tobacco users and not among tobacco users. Exposure to advertisements at bars/nightclubs did not predict the number of products used 6 months later. Conclusion Tobacco companies claim that marketing is targeted to those who already use the product, not to non-users. However, the current study indicates tobacco marketing in bars and nightclubs may encourage use among non-users and has no influence on current users. ","Adult-only venues such as bars and nightclubs remain increasingly important venues for tobacco companies to reach young adults. This study found that greater exposure to free samples and tobacco industry representatives in bars and nightclubs predicted a greater number of tobacco products used at follow-up, among wave 1 non-users, but with no effect among wave 1 users. Given that the effects of marketing were found only among non-users, this suggests that these venues may be important areas for future regulations to reduce initiation.

Tobacco Control,2020,What factors reliably predict electronic cigarette nicotine delivery?,Research Article,['gender'],"Background The ability of an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) to deliver nicotine effectively may be dependent on features of the device, the liquid and the user. Some of these features have been examined in previous work (eg, liquid nicotine concentration and puff topography), while others have not (eg, nicotine dependence and demographic characteristics). The purpose of this secondary analysis is to examine such features as predictors of e-cigarette nicotine delivery using a relatively large sample. Methods Four studies were combined in which e-cigarette-experienced users (n=63; 89% men; 75% white) and e-cigarette-naïve cigarette smokers (n=67; 66% men; 54% white) took 10 puffs from an eGo-style e-cigarette (~7.3 watts) filled with liquid that had a nicotine concentration of 18, 25 or 36 mg/mL. Thus, held constant across all studies were device features of battery/cartomiser style and power level and the topography parameters of puff number and interpuff interval. Blood was sampled before and after use, and puff topography was measured. Three general linear models were conducted to predict plasma nicotine concentrations (pre–post increase) for: (1) e-cigarette users only, (2) smokers only and (3) both groups combined. Predictor variables included puff duration, puff volume, liquid nicotine concentration, presession plasma nicotine concentration, nicotine dependence score (smokers only), gender and race. Results In all models tested, longer puff durations and higher liquid nicotine concentrations were associated significantly with increased nicotine delivery (ps<0.05). For e-cigarette users only, higher presession nicotine concentration was associated significantly with increased nicotine delivery (p<0.05). Conclusions Puff duration and liquid nicotine concentration may be among the more important factors to consider as regulators attempt to balance e-cigarette safety with efficacy. These findings should be interpreted in the context of devices with relatively low power output, a variable not studied here but likely also directly relevant to product regulation. ","Previous work suggests that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) nicotine delivery may be influenced by characteristics of the device (eg, power output), the liquid (eg, nicotine concentration) and/or the user (eg, puff number and duration). The present study uses a relatively large sample to determine which characteristics, including some yet to be examined in previous work (eg, gender and race), best predict e-cigarette nicotine delivery in those experienced versus naïve to e-cigarettes. Results show that when certain device and liquid features are held constant, puff duration and liquid nicotine concentration are consistent predictors of e-cigarette nicotine delivery in both e-cigarette-experienced users and e-cigarette-naïve cigarette smokers. Other individual-level factors not evaluated in previous work (eg, race and gender) did not predict e-cigarette nicotine delivery.

Tobacco Control,2020,Correlates of tobacco product reuptake and relapse among youth and adults in the USA: findings from the PATH Study Waves 1–3 (2013–2016),Research Article,"['bisexual', 'sexual orientation']","Objective This study examines sociodemographic and tobacco use correlates of reuptake and relapse to tobacco use across a variety of tobacco products (cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems, cigars, hookah and smokeless tobacco) among the US population. Design Data were drawn from the first three waves (2013–2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort study of US youth (ages 12–17) and adults (ages 18+). Reuptake (past 30-day use among previous tobacco users) and relapse (current use among former established users; adults only) were examined among previous users of at least one type of tobacco product at Wave 1 (W1) or Wave 2 (W2) (n=19 120 adults, n=3039 youth). Generalised estimating equations were used to evaluate the association between demographic and tobacco use characteristics at baseline, with reuptake/relapse at follow-up, over two 1-year periods (W1–W2 and W2–Wave 3). Results Any tobacco product reuptake occurred in 7.8% of adult previous users and 30.3% of youth previous users. Correlates of any tobacco reuptake included being male, non-Hispanic black and bisexual in adults, but race and sexual orientation were not consistent findings in youth. Among recent former users, relapse rates were greater (32.9%). Shorter time since last use and greater levels of tobacco dependence showed the strongest association with any tobacco relapse. Discussion Continued clinical and public health efforts to provide adults with tools to cope with tobacco dependence symptoms, especially within the first year or two after quitting, could help prevent relapse. ","Understanding the sociodemographic and tobacco use factors associated with reuptake and relapse to different tobacco products fills a large gap in the primarily cigarette-focused literature. This study evaluates the sociodemographic and tobacco use correlates of tobacco product reuptake among youth (ages 12–17) and adults (ages 18+) and tobacco product relapse among adults across any tobacco and specific classes of tobacco products available in the USA. Over a 1-year period, reuptake was less than 8% for all products except ENDS (16%) among adults, and higher for youth (between 15% and 25% across products). Correlates of any tobacco reuptake included being male, non-Hispanic black and bisexual in adults, but race and sexual orientation were not consistent findings in youth. These correlates among adults are similar to those seen in tobacco product initiation. Among adults, relapse rates were similar to reuptake. Relapse rates were higher (15%–28% across products) when restricting our analyses to recent (within the past 12 months) former established users. Shorter time since last use and greater levels of tobacco dependence showed the strongest association with any tobacco relapse. Continued clinical and public health efforts to provide adults with tools to cope with tobacco dependence, especially within the first year or two after quitting, could help prevent relapse to both cigarette and non-cigarette tobacco products.

Tobacco Control,2020,Smoke signals: monitoring illicit cigarettes and smoking behaviour in Colombia to support tobacco taxes,Research Article,['sex'],"Background A street cross-sectional survey in 2016 with a representative sample of 1697 smokers in five Colombian cities was used to estimate the penetration of illicit cigarettes (PIC). The first wave was collected 3 months before a 100% increase in tobacco excise tax, and a second wave collected data 9 months after tax reform was effective. Objective Analyse changes after a cigarette tax increase in PIC, prices and smoking behaviour patterns for five Colombian cities (63% of the market). Smoking behaviour includes consumption intensity, presentation (stick/pack) and place of purchase. Methods Repeated street cross-sectional survey with smokers’ self-report on smoking behaviour, last purchase information and direct observation of smokers’ packs. Sampling frame: smokers, men and women, aged 12 years or older, all income levels, resident in the five cities with the highest number of smokers representing 63% of cigarette market share (Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Cartagena and Cúcuta) with 1 733 316 smokers in 2013. Sample size was 1697 per wave, with confidence level 95%, margin of error 3.5% for Bogotá and Medellín and 5% for the other three cities. Smokers in second wave match first wave’s location, sex and age group. Illicit cigarettes were identified based on brand, health warnings and price. Results After the tax hike, the average real price of a 20-stick pack increased by 28.2% and by 23.1% for loose cigarettes. Illicit cigarettes represented 3.4% of total cigarette consumption in 2016 and increased to 6.4% in 2017, lower than the current industry estimate of 18%. Consumption intensity decreased: the proportion of heavy smokers (more than 10 cigarettes per day) wentdown from 37% in 2016 to 26% in 2017. Conclusion After the tax increase, Colombia’s PIC remained at low levels, and there is enough space for new tobacco tax hikes. ","Tobacco taxes are the most cost-effective policy tool to stop the tobacco epidemic. New tobacco tax increases are being blocked by fears of taxes leading to an upsurge of illicit trade which in turn would undermine the public health effect of the tobacco tax and generate losses in tobacco tax revenues. These fears are fed by biased overestimates of the penetration of illicit cigarette trade by TI. Previous independent estimates show an important overestimation of illicit cigarette trade by TI. There are no previous estimates for Colombia on illicit cigarette trade before and after a tax hike, so the gap it fills is evidence on changes on this trade before and after tobacco tax increases. Colombia does not have independent monitoring of illicit cigarette trade and patterns of smoking behaviour before and after tax increases. The paper fills the gap of monitoring illicit cigarette trade, prices and smoking behaviour using a set of indicators that can be used to support further tobacco tax increases. The paper proposes a novel method to build comparable individuals on multiple waves of street surveys on smoking behaviour. The method is a solution to overcome high levels of attrition associated with follow-ups of street surveys and collection of sensitive data such as patterns of smoking consumption. After a twofold increase in tobacco excise tax in Colombia, penetration of illicit cigarettes remained at moderate levels. The increase in illicit trade in Colombia after a symmetric nationwide tobacco tax hike was asymmetrical across regions, suggesting that regional factors can explain illicit trade better than tobacco taxes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Relationship Between Waterpipe Smoking and Body Weight: Population-Based Findings From Syria,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Cigarette smoking has well known effects on body weight, with current smokers weighing less than never-smokers, and cessation producing weight gain. Use of waterpipe (or “hookah”) is increasing in many parts of the world but its effects on body weight are not known. Methods: We compared body mass index (BMI) among 2,536 adults (age ≥18 years old), who were never, former, current nondaily, or current daily waterpipe smokers, drawn from 2 representative, population-based household surveys of adults in Aleppo, Syria. Results: Overall, 84.1% (n = 2,134) never-smoked waterpipe, 4.6% (n = 116) were former smokers, 9.9% (n = 251) were current nondaily smokers, and 1.4% (n = 35) were current daily smokers. Mean BMI of the sample was 30.2kg/m2 (SD = 6.3). Adjusted for cigarette smoking, number of chronic diseases, age, gender, income, and marital status, daily waterpipe users were 2.26 BMI units greater than never-smokers (beta = 2.26, 95% CI = 0.79–3.72), and had nearly threefold odds of being obese (odds ratio = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.06–7.76). Nondaily and former waterpipe users were similar to never-smokers in terms of BMI and obesity risk. Conclusion: Results indicate that daily waterpipe users, compared to never-users, have higher BMI, translating into 6 extra kilograms of weight on average, and are 3 times as likely to be obese.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Reinforcing Effects of Nicotine in Humans and Nonhuman Primates: A Review of Intravenous Self-Administration Evidence and Future Directions for Research,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Cigarette smoking is largely driven by the reinforcing properties of nicotine. Intravenous (IV) self-administration procedures are the gold standard for investigating the reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs. The goal of this review was to examine the results of published investigations of the reinforcing effects of nicotine measured using IV self-administration procedures in humans and nonhuman primates. Results: The body of literature using nonhuman primate subjects indicates nicotine functions as a positive reinforcer when available for self-administration via IV catheters. However, it can also be difficult to establish IV nicotine self-administration in nonhuman primates and sometimes supplemental strategies have been required (e.g., priming injections or food deprivation) before subjects acquire the behavior. Although the body of literature using human subjects is limited, the evidence indicates nicotine functions as a reinforcer via the IV route of administration in adult cigarette smokers. Rates of nicotine self-injection can be variable across subjects and responding is sometimes inconsistent across sessions in both humans and nonhuman primates. Conclusions: The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, enacted in 2009, gave the Food and Drug Administration regulatory authority over the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Research examining the threshold reinforcing doses for initiation and maintenance of nicotine self-administration, comparisons of the reinforcing effects of nicotine in adolescent versus adult subjects, investigations of gender differences in the reinforcing effects of nicotine, and studies of the abuse liability of non-nicotine tobacco product constituents and their ability to alter the reinforcing effects of nicotine will inform potential tobacco regulatory actions.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Nicotine Metabolite Ratio in Pregnancy Measured by trans-3′-Hydroxycotinine to Cotinine Ratio: Characteristics and Relationship With Smoking Cessation,article,['trans'],"Introduction: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps nonpregnant smokers quit, but there is no evidence that standard dose NRT is effective in pregnancy. As nicotine metabolism increases in pregnancy, this could reduce NRT efficacy. Using the ratio of trans-3′-hydroxycotinine to cotinine, the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), we investigated relationships between the rate of nicotine metabolism, maternal characteristics and smoking cessation in pregnant women recruited to a randomized controlled trial of NRT. Methods: Data from 1,050 pregnant smokers in the Smoking, Nicotine and Pregnancy trial who were of 12–24 weeks gestation had exhaled carbon monoxide readings of ≥8 ppm at recruitment and who were randomized to NRT or placebo patches were used. Linear and logistic regression investigated associations between maternal characteristics and NMR and also between NMR and subsequent validated cessation from smoking. Results: Six hundred and sixty-two women (63%) provided blood samples for NMR estimation. Higher NMR was associated with increased cigarette consumption prior to pregnancy. At 1 month (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.76–0.99; p = .043) and delivery (OR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.66–0.95; p = .010), there was a significant negative association between a 0.1 unit increase in NMR and odds of achieving cessation after adjusting for possible confounders. There was no evidence for an interaction between a 0.1 unit increase in NMR and treatment assignment on the odds of cessation at 1 month post-quit date (p = .556). Conclusion: Pregnant women who metabolize nicotine more rapidly are less likely to achieve cessation when they try to quit smoking. There is no evidence that NRT is more effective in women who metabolize nicotine more slowly.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Smoking Among Sexual Minorities: Are There Racial Differences?,article,"['gender', 'heterosexual', 'sexual minorities', 'sexual minority']","Introduction: Smoking prevalence is higher among sexual minorities compared to their heterosexual peers. However, very little is known about potential racial differences in smoking among sexual minority populations. We examined differences by race in smoking status among a robust sample of sexual minorities. Methods: We used data from the 2010 Social Justice Sexuality project, a large national convenience sample of sexual minority adults that oversampled individuals from racial minority groups. Log-Poisson multivariable regression models were employed to determine the risk of current smoking among sexual minority individuals by race after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Results: Among smokers, 22.35% identified as White, 26.98% identified as Black, 19.38% identified as Latino/Hispanic, 5.58% identified as Asian American, and 25.67% were other/multiracial. In fully adjusted gender stratified models, Black men (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50, 0.75) and Asian American men (aRR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.75) were at lower risk of smoking compared to White men. Black women were the only to remain statistically significant for decreased risk of smoking in fully adjusted gender stratified models (aRR = 0.78, 95 % CI = 0.65, 0.95). Conclusions: Among sexual minorities, Black and Asian American individuals consistently were at decreased risk of current smoking compared to their White peers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Association Between Tobacco Control Policy and Educational Inequalities in Smoking Cessation in the Netherlands from 1988 Through 2011,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Tobacco control policies seemed to have failed to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in smoking in the past. It has been argued that a comprehensive mix of policies is needed. Our aim was to assess whether tobacco control policy development in the Netherlands between 1988 and 2011 was associated with educational inequalities in smoking cessation and cigarette consumption. Methods: Data were derived from the cross-sectional Dutch Continuous Survey of Smoking Habits, with a study sample of 259,140 respondents from 1988 through 2011. Outcomes were the quit ratio and mean number of cigarettes smoked per day. The determinant was the Tobacco Control Scale (TCS). We used multilevel logistic regression modeling, with years, quarters, and individuals as levels, and controlled for sex, age, and time. Results: A significant association between the TCS and smoking cessation was found in 2001–2011, but not in 1988–2000. Associations for low- and high-education groups were similar (OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.12–1.34 and OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.03–1.32 respectively). The TCS was not significantly associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day for either the low- or high-education groups (B = −0.09; 95% CI = −0.46–0.27 and B = −0.59; 95% CI = −1.24–0.06 respectively). Conclusions: Strong tobacco control policies introduced in the Netherlands after 2000 were positively associated with national trends in smoking cessation, whereas weaker policies introduced gradually before 2000 were not. However, these measures do not seem to have either widened or narrowed educational inequalities in smoking cessation rates—both groups benefitted about equally.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Increasing the Value of an Alternative Monetary Reinforcer Reduces Cigarette Choice in Adolescents,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Smoking can be conceptualized as an operant behavior maintained by the reinforcing effects of cigarettes. Changing the magnitude and availability of alternative reinforcers should shift behavior away from smoking. Adults’ smoking behavior is sensitive to the magnitude and availability of alternative reinforcers; however, the extent to which the same is true for adolescents has not yet been shown in the laboratory. Methods: To test the sensitivity of adolescent smoking behavior to changes in the magnitude of alternative reinforcement, we gave adolescents who abstained overnight the opportunity to make 20 choices between receiving two puffs of their usual-brand cigarette or money. The magnitude of the monetary reinforcer was varied across sessions in counterbalanced order ($0.00, $0.10, and $0.50). Results: Results indicated that adolescents’ choices for puffs decreased as a function of increasing monetary reinforcer magnitude, while money choices increased. This effect was moderated by baseline smoking level and by gender, such that heavier-smoking participants and males made more cigarette choices when the alternative monetary value was zero, and decreased their choices more steeply in response to increasing monetary value. Conclusions: The current study validates a laboratory choice procedure for studying smoking in adolescents, and demonstrates that adolescent smoking behavior is sensitive to changes in the magnitude of concurrently available monetary reinforcers. The current paradigm can be adapted and applied to explore the effects of other variables that may affect cigarette choice in adolescents.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Trends in Awareness and Use of Electronic Cigarettes Among US Adults, 2010–2013",article,['sex'],"Introduction: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) marketing has increased considerably since the product entered the US market in 2007, thereby warranting additional surveillance to monitor recent trends in population-level awareness and utilization. We assessed the prevalence, characteristics, and trends in e-cigarette awareness and use among nationally representative samples of US adults during 2010–2013. Methods: Data came from the 2010–2013 HealthStyles survey, an annual consumer-based web survey of US adults aged ≥18 years. Sample sizes ranged from 2,505 (2010) to 4,170 (2012). Descriptive statistics were used to assess e-cigarette awareness, ever use, and current use (use within the past 30 days) overall and by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, income, US region, and cigarette smoking status. Trends were assessed using logistic regression. Results: During 2010–2013, increases (p < .05) were observed for e-cigarette awareness (40.9%–79.7%), ever use (3.3%–8.5%), and current use (1.0%–2.6%). Awareness increased among all socio demographic subpopulations during 2010–2013 (p < .05); an increase in ever use of e-cigarettes occurred among all sociodemographic groups except those aged 18–24 years, Hispanics, and those living in the Midwest (p < .05). During 2010–2013, ever use increased among current (9.8%–36.5%) and former (2.5%–9.6%) cigarette smokers (p < .05), but it remained unchanged among never smokers (1.3%–1.2%). Conclusions: Awareness and use of e-cigarettes increased considerably among US adults during 2010–2013. In 2013, more than one-third of current cigarette smokers reported having ever used e-cigarettes. Given the uncertain public health impact of e-cigarettes, continued surveillance of emerging use patterns is critical for public health planning.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Increasing Prevalence of Electronic Cigarette Use Among Smokers Hospitalized in 5 US Cities, 2010–2013",article,['sex'],"Introduction: Little is known about the pattern of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use over time or among smokers with medical comorbidity. Methods: We assessed current cigarette smokers’ use of e-cigarettes during the 30 days before admission to 9 hospitals in 5 geographically dispersed US cities: Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA; Kansas City, KS; New York, NY; and Portland, OR. Each hospital was conducting a randomized controlled trial as part of the NIH-sponsored Consortium of Hospitals Advancing Research on Tobacco (CHART). We conducted a pooled analysis using multiple logistic regression to examine changes in e-cigarette use over time and to identify correlates of e-cigarette use. Results: Among 4,660 smokers hospitalized between July 2010 and December 2013 (mean age 57 years, 57% male, 71% white, 56% some college, average 14 cigarettes/day), 14% reported using an e-cigarette during the 30 days before admission. The prevalence of e-cigarette use increased from 1.1% in 2010 to 10.3% in 2011, 10.2% in 2012, and 18.4% in 2013; the increase was statistically significant (p < .0001) after adjustment for age, sex, education, and CHART study. Younger, better educated, and heavier smokers were more likely to use e-cigarettes. Smokers who were Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and who had Medicaid or no insurance were less likely to use e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use also varied by CHART project and by geographic region. Conclusions: E-cigarette use increased substantially from 2010 to 2013 among a large sample of hospitalized adult cigarette smokers. E-cigarette use was more common among heavier smokers and among those who were younger, white, and who had higher socioeconomic status.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Innovations in Translational Sex and Gender-Sensitive Tobacco Research,article,['gender'],"Tobacco use is a global epidemic with more than 5 million people dying every year from smoking-related causes. In the United States, tobacco use leads to 440,000 deaths per year and an annual economic burden of $96 billion in medical expenses and $97 billion in lost productivity. Smoking causes extensive medical consequences and many of these risks are greater for women compared to men, even after equating for tobacco exposure. Female smokers appear to be at a greater risk of developing lung cancer and are more susceptible to tobacco carcinogens than male smokers. Smoking is associated with an earlier age of breast cancer, and female smokers experience greater risks of oral cancer than male smokers. Even cancers that have historically been more prevalent in men (e.g., bladder cancer) are now demonstrating similar prevalence as rates continue to increase among female smokers. The risk of coronary heart disease is greater for female smokers than for male smokers. A meta-analysis examining the impact of smoking on coronary heart disease by gender in 76 cohorts from 1966–2010 (2.4 million participants) showed that, after controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors, female smokers demonstrated a 25% greater risk of coronary heart disease than male smokers.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntu335,"McKee, Sherry A.; Weinberger, Andrea H.","Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT; Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY"
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Sex Differences in Hormonal Responses to Stress and Smoking Relapse: A Prospective Examination,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been shown to be associated with smoking relapse. No study has directly examined the role of sex differences in this relationship. Methods: Nicotine dependent men (n = 52) and women (n = 46) interested in cessation completed 2 laboratory stress sessions during ad libitum smoking and after 48hr of abstinence. The laboratory session included baseline, stress, and recovery periods. Blood and saliva samples were collected at the end of each period for the measurement of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Self-report measures of craving and withdrawal symptoms were also collected. Participants attended 4 weekly follow-up sessions for counseling where they provided biological samples and self-report measures including smoking status. Relapse was defined by smoking cigarettes for 7 consecutive days post-cessation. Results: Results showed that 60 participants relapsed during the 4-week period. Cox regression models from the abstinence session showed that cortisol levels regardless of source were predictive of relapse but the direction of prediction was sex dependent (Sex × Hormone, all ps < .05). Follow-up analyses further revealed that lower cortisol levels predicted relapse in men whereas greater cortisol levels predicted relapse in women (ps < .05). Enhanced craving predicted early smoking relapse in men but not in women (ps < .05). Data from the ad libitum session showed no differences in predicting relapse. Conclusion: These findings highlight that sex differences in the hormonal response to stress and subjective craving during nicotine withdrawal are critical predictors of risk for understanding early relapse.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Nicotine Withdrawal Increases Stress-Associated Genes in the Nucleus Accumbens of Female Rats in a Hormone-Dependent Manner,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Previous work led to our hypothesis that sex differences produced by nicotine withdrawal are modulated by stress and dopamine systems in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We investigated our hypothesis by studying intact females to determine whether the mechanisms that promote withdrawal are ovarian-hormone mediated. Methods: Female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) or received sham surgery (intact) on postnatal day (PND 45–46). On PND 60, they received sham surgery (controls) or were prepared with nicotine pumps. Fourteen days later, half of the rats had their pumps removed (nicotine withdrawal) and the other half received sham surgery (nicotine exposure). Twenty-four hours later, the rats were tested for anxiety-like behavior using the elevated plus maze and light/dark transfer procedures. The NAcc was then dissected for analysis of several genes related to stress (CRF, UCN, CRF-R1, CRF-R2, CRF-BP, and Arrb2) or receptors for dopamine (Drd1 and Drd2) and estradiol (Esr2). Results: During withdrawal, intact females displayed an increase in anxiety-like behavior in both tests and CRF, UCN, and Drd1 gene expression. During nicotine exposure, intact females displayed a decrease in CRF-R1, CRF-R2, Drd3, and Esr2 gene expression and an increase in CRF-BP. This pattern of results was absent in OVX females. Conclusions: Nicotine withdrawal produced an increase in anxiety-like behavior and stress-associated genes in intact females that is distinct from changes produced by nicotine exposure. The latter effects were absent in OVX females, suggesting that stress produced by withdrawal is ovarian-hormone mediated. These findings have important implications towards understanding tobacco use liability among females.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Gender and Stimulus Control of Smoking Behavior,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Gender differences in smoking behavior have been proposed to account for poorer outcomes among women attempting to quit. Specifically, it has been suggested that women’s smoking behavior is less motivated by nicotine-seeking and more driven by environmental cues. To date, however, few real-world studies have examined the hypothesis that women’s smoking is under greater stimulus control. Methods: One hundred and ninety four daily smokers (men = 107; women = 87) completed 3 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) monitoring that provided data on real-world smoking behavior by reporting on situational contexts shown by previous research to influence smoking behavior (including social setting, cigarette availability, alcohol consumption, and mood). Results: Analyses of particular cues found few gender differences; however, men’s smoking increased to a greater extent compared with women’s when they were with others who were smoking. Idiographic analyses that allow individual subjects to have different directions of linkage to situational cues also were conducted to assess how predictable subjects’ smoking was from a range of contextual characteristics. Compared with women, men’s smoking was significantly more closely tied to food/alcohol consumption and tended to be more closely tied to social context. No other gender differences were found. Conclusions: EMA analyses suggest that men and women are similarly influenced by cues, including mood. Where there were gender differences, it was men rather than women whose smoking behavior was more influenced by cues. The data contradict the hypothesis that women’s smoking is more influenced by cues.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Gender Differences in Responses to Cues Presented in the Natural Environment of Cigarette Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Although the evidence is mixed, female smokers appear to have more difficulty quitting smoking than male smokers. Craving, stress, and negative affect have been hypothesized as potential factors underlying gender differences in quit rates. Methods: In the current study, the cue-reactivity paradigm was used to assess craving, stress, and negative affect in response to cues presented in the natural environment of cigarette smokers using ecological momentary assessment. Seventy-six daily smokers (42% female) responded to photographs (smoking, stress, and neutral) presented 4 times per day on an iPhone over the course of 2 weeks. Results: Both smoking and stress cues elicited stronger cigarette craving and stress responses compared to neutral cues. Compared with males, females reported higher levels of post-stress cue craving, stress, and negative affect, but response to smoking cues did not differ by gender. Discussion: Findings from this project were largely consistent with results from laboratory-based research and extend previous work by measuring response to cues in the natural environment of cigarette smokers. This study extends previous cue reactivity ecological momentary assessment research by using a new platform and by measuring response to stress cues outside of the laboratory. Findings from this project highlight the importance of addressing coping in response to stress cues in clinical settings, especially when working with female smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Sex Differences in Acute Relief of Abstinence-Induced Withdrawal and Negative Affect due to Nicotine Content in Cigarettes,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Acute cigarette smoking may relieve withdrawal and negative affect due to tobacco abstinence to a greater extent in women versus men. Yet, the relative contribution of the cigarette’s nicotine content to this sex difference is not clear. Methods: Non-quitting dependent adult smokers (N = 44; 21 males, 23 females) participated in 2 virtually identical sessions, each after abstaining overnight (CO < 10 ppm) and differing only in the nicotine content of the designated cigarette. While blind to brand markings, they consumed a total of 24 puffs in controlled fashion for 2hr in each session, either from a nicotine (Quest 1, 0.6mg) or denicotinized (Quest 3, 0.05mg) cigarette. Withdrawal symptoms were obtained before and after smoking, and negative affect was assessed after each period of cigarette exposure consisting of 6 puffs every 25min. Results: Men and women did not differ in baseline withdrawal and negative affect due to overnight abstinence, but reductions in each symptom were significantly influenced by the interaction of sex × nicotine/denicotinized cigarette (both p < .05). In men, but not in women, each symptom was generally decreased more by the nicotine versus denicotinized cigarette, and the nicotine cigarette reduced each to a greater degree in men versus women. Conclusions: Sex differences in relief of abstinence-induced withdrawal and negative affect due to the nicotine content in cigarettes are consistent with prior research indicating that nicotine per se, compared to non-nicotine smoke stimuli, is less rewarding in women versus men.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Sex Differences in Time Perception During Smoking Abstinence,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Nicotine withdrawal leads to impulsive decision-making, which reflects a preference for smaller, immediate rewards and often prompts a relapse to smoking. The mechanism by which nicotine withdrawal leads to impulsive decision-making is not well known. An essential dimension of decision-making is time perception. Impulsive decisions reflect intolerance of temporal delays and the perception that time is passing more slowly. Sex may be an important factor in impulsive decision-making and time perception, but no studies have investigated whether sex moderates the effects of nicotine withdrawal on impulsive decision-making and time perception. Methods: Thirty-three (12 female) adult smokers completed 2 laboratory sessions: following 24-hr abstinence and once smoking-as-usual (order counterbalanced, abstinence biochemically verified). Participants completed 2 time perception tasks, a decision-making task, and self-report measures of craving, withdrawal, and mood. Results: During time reproduction, males overestimated time during abstinence compared to smoking, whereas there was no session effect for females. On the time discrimination task, smokers were less accurate during abstinence, and this effect tended to be stronger among females. In general, males had higher discounting rates compared with females, but there was no effect of abstinence.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Gender Differences in Medication Use and Cigarette Smoking Cessation: Results From the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey,article,['gender'],"Introduction: There is conflicting evidence for gender differences in smoking cessation, and there has been little research on gender differences in smoking cessation medication (SCM) use and effectiveness. Using longitudinal data from the International Tobacco Control Four Country Surveys (ITC-4) conducted in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia, we examined gender differences in the incidence of quit attempts, reasons for quitting, use of SCMs, reasons for discontinuing use of SCMs, and rates of smoking cessation. Methods: Data were analyzed from adult smokers participating in the ITC-4, annual waves 2006–2011 (n = 7,825), as well as a subsample of smokers (n = 1,079) who made quit attempts within 2 months of survey. Adjusted modeling utilized generalized estimating equations. Results: There were no gender differences in the likelihood of desire to quit, plans to quit, or quit attempts between survey waves. Among quit attempters, women had 31% lower odds of successfully quitting (OR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.51, 0.94). Stratified by medication use, quit success was lower among women who did not use any SCMs (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.90), and it was no different from men when medications were used (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.46, 1.16). In particular, self-selected use of nicotine patch and varenicline contributed to successful quitting among women. Conclusions: Women may have more difficulty quitting than men, and SCMs use may help attenuate this difference.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Nicotine Concentrations With Electronic Cigarette Use: Effects of Sex and Flavor,article,['sex'],"Introduction: This study examined overall changes in nicotine concentrations when using a popular e-cigarette and 18mg/mL nicotine e-Juice, and it further explored effects of sex and flavorings on these concentrations. Methods: We recruited nontreatment-seeking smokers who were willing to try e-cigarettes for 2 weeks and abstain from cigarette smoking. Subjects were randomized to either menthol tobacco or non-menthol tobacco-flavored e-cigarette use for 7–10 days, and the next week they were crossed over to the other condition. On the last day of e-cigarette use of each flavor, subjects completed a laboratory session in which they used the e-cigarette for 5min ad libitum. Nicotine concentrations were obtained 5min before and 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30min after the onset of e-cigarette use. Results: Twenty subjects completed at least 1 monitoring session. Nicotine concentrations significantly increased from baseline to 5min by 4ng/mL at the first laboratory session (p < .01) and by 5.1ng/mL at the second laboratory session (p < .01). Combining sessions, there were no main effects of sex or preferred flavor (based on smoking history) on changes in nicotine concentrations. After adding preferred flavor, sex, and visit order to the model, there was a significant preferred flavor by sex interaction (p < .01), such that women who received nonpreferred flavors had lower nicotine concentrations and rated their e-cigarette as less likeable (p < .01). Conclusion: We found nicotine concentrations significantly increase after e-cigarette use for 5min, and flavor may impact nicotine concentrations with e-cigarette use in women.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Gender Differences in a Randomized Controlled Trial Treating Tobacco Use Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Mental Health Concerns,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Treatment of tobacco use in mental health settings is rare despite high rates of comorbidity. With a focus on early intervention, we evaluated a tobacco treatment intervention among adolescents and young adults recruited from outpatient, school-based, and residential mental health settings and tested for gender differences. Methods: Intervention participants received computerized motivational feedback at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months and were offered 12 weeks of cessation counseling and nicotine patches. Usual care participants received a self-help guide and brief cessation advice. We examined 7-day point prevalence abstinence with biochemical confirmation at 3, 6, and 12 months; smoking reduction; and 24-hr quit attempts. Results: At baseline, the sample (N = 60, 52% female, mean age = 19.5±2.9 years, 40% non-Hispanic Caucasian) averaged 7±6 cigarettes/day, 62% smoked daily, 38% smoked ≤ 30min of waking, 12% intended to quit in the next month, 47% had a parent who smoked, and 3 of 5 of participants’ closest friends smoked on average. During the 12-month study, 47% of the sample reduced their smoking, 80% quit for 24 hr, and 11%, 13%, and 17% confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, respectively, with no differences by treatment condition (ps > .400). Over time, abstinence was greater among girls (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 8.9) than among boys, and abstinence was greater for lighter smokers than heavier smokers (AOR = 4.5) (p < .05). No mental health or other measured variables predicted abstinence. Conclusions: Adolescent and young adult smokers with mental health concerns are a challenging group to engage and to effectively treat for tobacco addiction, particularly heavier smokers and boys.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Targeting the Noradrenergic System for Gender-Sensitive Medication Development for Tobacco Dependence,article,"['gender', 'sex']","Introduction: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for both women and men in the United States, and women often experience poorer smoking cessation outcomes than men. Preliminary evidence suggests there are sex differences in medication effectiveness for smoking cessation. However, current medications do not take into account gender-sensitive treatment development and efficacy, underscoring the importance of this underdeveloped area of research. Methods: We reviewed preclinical and clinical evidence for gender differences in the inability to quit smoking by examining (a) the effect of increased negative affect and stress reactivity on smoking outcomes in women and (b) smoking for nicotine reinforcement in men. We also reviewed the current literature targeting the noradrenergic system as a novel gender-sensitive treatment strategy for tobacco dependence. Results: We hypothesize that noradrenergic agents that normalize noradrenergic activity may differentially attenuate stress reactivity in women and nicotine-related reinforcement in men, indicating that targeting the noradrenergic system for smoking cessation may be effective for both genders, with benefits operating through sex-specific mechanisms. Conclusions: Converging lines of preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that gender-sensitive approaches to medication development for smoking cessation are a critical next step for addressing low quit rates and exacerbated health risks among women. Evidence reviewed indicates that smoking activates different brain systems modulated by noradrenergic activity in women versus men, and noradrenergic compounds may preferentially target these gender-sensitive systems.

Results: The analysis indicated that 1 additional weekly occurrence of exercise led to a 0.3% decline in the probability of being a smoker and led to a 4.1% reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked by a smoker during a month, a result that was robust to stratification by gender and race/ethnicity. Consistent with the national guidelines, frequencies of physical activity of at least 7 times per week appeared to exhibit the biggest benefits in terms of reduction in smoking for both genders and across races/ethnicities. Conclusions: Reduction in health-damaging smoking behavior among adolescents could be an additional benefit of being physically active. This research documented a new pathway by which even moderate increases in physical activity could result in improved health outcomes by reducing smoking.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Determinants of Cigarette Smoking Initiation in Jordanian Schoolchildren: Longitudinal Analysis,article,['gender'],"Objective: To identify determinants of cigarette smoking initiation, by gender, among schoolchildren in Irbid, Jordan. Methods:  Between 2008 and 2011, data were collected annually using self-reported questionnaires over 4-years in a prospective cohort of 1,781 students recruited from all 7th grade classes in 19 secondary schools, selected out of a total 60, using probability-proportionate-to-size method. Independent predictors of smoking initiation were identified among the cigarette naïve participants ( N = 1,454) with mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression.  Results:  Participants were 12.6 years of age on average at baseline. 29.8% of the 1,454 students (37.2% of boys and 23.7% of girls) initiated cigarette smoking by 10th grade. Of those who initiated ( n = 498), 47.2% of boys and 37.2% of girls initiated smoking in the 8th grade. Determinants of cigarette smoking initiation included ever smoking a waterpipe, low cigarette refusal self-efficacy, intention to start smoking cigarettes, and having friends who smoked. For girls, familial smoking was also predictive of cigarette initiation.  Conclusion: This study shows that many Jordanian youth have an intention to initiate cigarette smoking and are susceptible to cigarette smoking modeled by peers and that girls are influenced as well by familial cigarette smoking. Prevention efforts should be tailored to address culturally relevant gender norms, help strengthen adolescents’ self-efficacy to refuse cigarettes, and foster strong non-smoking social norms.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Health Care Expenditures Attributable to Smoking in Military Veterans,article,['gender'],"Introduction: The health effects of cigarette smoking have been estimated to account for between 6%–8% of U.S. health care expenditures. We estimated Veterans Health Administration (VHA) health care costs attributable to cigarette smoking. Methods: VHA survey and administrative data provided the number of Veteran enrollees, current and former smoking prevalence, and the cost of 4 types of care for groups defined by age, gender, and region. Cost and smoking status could not be linked at the enrollee level, so we used smoking attributable fractions estimated in sample of U.S. residents where the linkage could be made. Results: The 7.7 million Veterans enrolled in VHA received $40.2 billion in VHA provided health services in 2010. We estimated that $2.7 billion in VHA costs were attributable to the health effects of smoking. This was 7.6% of the $35.3 billion spent on the types of care for which smoking-attributable fractions could be determined. The fraction of inpatient costs that was attributable to smoking (11.4%) was greater than the fraction of ambulatory care cost attributable to smoking (5.3%). More cost was attributable to current smokers ($1.7 billion) than to former smokers ($983 million). Conclusions: The fraction of VHA costs attributable to smoking is similar to that of other health care systems. Smoking among Veterans is slowly decreasing, but prevalence remains high in Veterans with psychiatric and substance use disorders, and in younger and female Veterans. VHA has adopted a number of smoking cessation programs that have the potential for reducing future smoking-attributable costs.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Menstrual Cycle Phase Effects in the Gender Dimorphic Stress Cue Reactivity of Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction: We previously reported that female smokers evidence greater subjective craving and stress/emotional reactivity to personalized stress cues than males. The present study employed the same dataset to assess whether females in the follicular versus luteal phase of the menstrual cycle accounted for the gender differences. Methods:  Two objective criteria, onset of menses and luteinizing hormone surge (evaluated via home testing kits), were used to determine whether female smokers were in either the follicular ( n = 22) or the luteal ( n = 15) phase of their menstrual cycle, respectively. The females and a sample of male smokers ( n = 53) were then administered a laboratory-based cue reactivity paradigm that involved assessment of craving, stress, and emotional reactivity in response to counterbalanced presentations of both a personalized stress script and neutral/relaxed script.  Results: While there were no significant differences between females in the follicular versus luteal phase on any outcome measure, females in the luteal menstrual phase reported greater craving than males whereas females in the follicular phase reported greater stress and arousal than males and perceived the stress cues as more emotionally aversive than males. Conclusions: This preliminary investigation suggests that gender differences in craving versus affective responding to stress cues may, in part, be explained variation by menstrual cycle phase. Study limitations and implications of the findings for future research and treatment are briefly discussed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Exposure to Nicotine During Pregnancy and Altered Learning and Memory in the Rat Offspring,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Prenatal exposure to nicotine can cause many fetal developmental problems. This study determined the influence of nicotine during pregnancy on the development of cognitive behavior in the offspring. Methods: Nicotine was administered to pregnant rats through implanted osmotic mini-pumps at 6mg/kg/day and flow rate of 60 μl/day for whole pregnancy from gestational day 4. Fetal and offspring body and brain weight was measured. Learning and memory were tested in adult offspring with Morris water maze; Learning and memory-related receptors were measured. Results:  The results showed that exposure to prenatal nicotine (PN) not only caused fetal growth restriction, but also had long-term effects on learning and memory in the offspring. The PN offspring exhibited longer escape latency regardless of sex. The number of passing the platform was significantly less in the PN offspring than that of the control. The expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein of N -methyl- D -aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) in the hippocampus was significantly increased, whereas alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α 7 nAChR) protein was decreased with unchanged α 7 nAChR mRNA in the PN offspring.  Conclusion:  The data provided novel information on the PN-affected development in learning and memory in the offspring, suggesting that α 7 nAChR and NMDAR1 in the hippocampus might be the targets for actions of PN in association with memory impairment.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Opinions About Electronic Cigarette Use in Smoke-Free Areas Among U.S. Adults, 2012",article,['sex'],"Introduction: In the United States, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are currently unregulated, extensively marketed, and experiencing a rapid increase in use. The purpose of this study was to examine the opinions of U.S. adults about e-cigarette use in smoke-free public areas. Methods:  Data were obtained from the online HealthStyle survey administered to a probability sample of a nationally representative online panel. The study included 4,043U.S. adults, aged 18 years or older who responded to this question, “Do you think e-cigarette should be allowed to be used in public areas where tobacco smoking is prohibited?” Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine opinions on e-cigarette use in smoke-free areas by sex, age, race/ethnicity, household income, education, census region, and cigarette smoking status and e-cigarette awareness and ever use.  Results: Overall, about 40% of adults were uncertain whether e-cigarettes should be allowed in smoke-free areas, 37% opposed, while 23% favored their use in smoke-free public places. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that adults who were aware, ever used e-cigarettes, and current cigarette smokers were more likely to express an “in favor” opinion than adults who expressed an uncertain opinion (don’t know). Conclusion: Over 75% of U.S. adults reported uncertainty or disapproval of the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free areas. Current cigarette smokers, adults aware or have ever used e-cigarettes were more supportive to exempting e-cigarettes from smoking restrictions. With impending regulation and the changing e-cigarette landscape, continued monitoring and research on public opinions about e-cigarette use in smoke-free places are needed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Evaluation of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption and Cigarette Smoking Among Youth,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Research across the past 4 decades has supported a cross-sectional association between adult cigarette smoking and lower fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC), and emerging research suggests higher FVC may predict cessation. Among youth, findings are limited to a few cross-sectional studies with somewhat mixed results. Here we evaluated the FVC-smoking association among youth both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Methods:  We analyzed data from a subsample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979: Child and Young Adult. The subsample included adolescents aged 14–18 years at baseline in the year 2004. Multivariable cross-sectional analyses assessed whether baseline FVC was associated with smoking frequency among ever-smokers ( n = 578). Longitudinally, the study assessed whether baseline FVC predicted smoking progression among baseline never-smokers who tried a cigarette by 4-year follow-up ( n = 388). Multivariable regression models adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, and health behavior orientation.  Results:  Cross-sectionally, youth who consumed fruit ≥2 times per day were 53% less likely (RR = 0.47; p < .05) than those who typically did not consume fruit to be in a higher smoking frequency category. Longitudinally, the fruit consumption and smoking association was not significant (RR = 0.61; p = .282). There were no significant associations observed between vegetable consumption and smoking.  Conclusions: Fruit consumption, but not vegetable consumption, was inversely associated with smoking frequency cross-sectionally but not longitudinally. Further research is needed to provide information on the consistency of the FVC-smoking relationship among youth and may help to elucidate possible explanatory mechanisms.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Cessation Among State Quitline Participants with a Mental Health Condition,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Telephone quitlines are an effective treatment option for tobacco cessation in the general population. Many participants who use quitline services have mental health conditions (MHC), yet few published studies have examined the use of quitline services in this population. This study examined the prevalence of MHC among state quitline participants and compared cessation outcomes among those with and without MHC. Methods: Demographic and tobacco use data were collected at enrollment and 7 months post-enrollment using standardized assessments for 10,720 eligible participants who enrolled in a state quitline between September, 2010 and August, 2012. Results:  The prevalence of self-reported MHC was 19.8% (2,086/10,720 callers). The intent to treat quit rate for participants with a MHC was 16.4% compared to 21.5% for those without a MHC ( p < .001), and the responder quit rate was 36.9% for those with a MHC compared to 44.4% for those without ( p < .001). The adjusted odds ratio describing the association of MHC status and tobacco cessation was identical for both the intent-to-treat and responder populations, and indicated that participants with MHC were 23% less likely to quit ( p < .05).  Conclusions: This study identified that participants with MHC accessed a state quitline, but were less likely to quit. The finding was independent of other factors influencing tobacco cessation, such as gender, race, and education. These findings indicate that although quitline services are an option for tobacco cessation among persons with MHC, further research is needed to determine why cessation rates are lower.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Gender Differences in Negative Reinforcement Smoking Expectancies,article,['gender'],"Background: Previous research suggests that females may be more motivated to smoke for negative reinforcement (NR) than males. However, it remains unclear whether gender differences in smoking outcome expectancies for negative smoking reinforcement—an important theoretical and clinical target defined as beliefs that smoking alleviates negative affect—exist above and beyond gender differences in depression and/or other outcome expectancies. Methods:  Relations between gender and negative smoking reinforcement expectancies were examined in two independent samples. Sample 1 consisted of non-treatment seeking daily smokers (Male n = 188; Female n = 91) recruited from Southern California (49.5% Black, 32.2% Caucasian, and 18.3% other race/ethnicity). Sample 2 consisted of treatment seeking daily smokers (Male n = 257; Female n = 237) in Northern Florida and Vermont (10.7% Black, 82.9% Caucasian, and 6.4% other).  Results:  Females (vs. males) reported stronger NR smoking expectancies with and without statistically controlling for nicotine dependence, other smoking expectancies, and anxiety and depression in both samples (βs = .06 to .14, p s = .06 to < .001).  Conclusions: Beliefs that smoking alleviates negative affect may reflect a gender-specific etiological process disproportionately prominent in women. Enhancing ability to cope with negative affect without smoking or challenge NR expectancies may be particularly important for cessation treatment in women.

The purpose of this study was to examine changes in LITS over time among Blacks, Hispanic/Latinos (Latinos) and non-Hispanic Whites (Whites). Methods:  Data from the California Tobacco Surveys from 1990, 1992, and 1996 (Time 1 [T1]) were combined and compared to combined data from 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 (Time 2 [T2]). T1 participants ( N = 50,424) included Blacks ( n = 3,029), Latinos ( n = 7,910), and Whites ( n = 39,485). T2 participants ( N = 53,005) included Blacks ( n = 5,460), Latinos ( n = 14,273), and Whites ( n = 33,246).  Results: LITS increased by a factor of 12.9% to a rate of 79.6% (76.0–83.2) among Latinos, by 19.4% to a rate of 74.4% (70.9–77.9) among Blacks, and by 51.7% to a rate of 48.9% (47.5–50.3) among Whites. In unadjusted analyses at T1, females were more likely to be LITS than males across ethnic groups. At T2, this sex difference was maintained among Whites, but not Blacks and Latinos. Females were significantly more likely to be LITS than males when controlling for demographic variables. Conclusions: The present study found that LITS rates increased over time for male and female Black, Latino and White adults. There is a need for increased tobacco control attention to LITS across all ethnic groups, but with additional focus on Blacks, Latinos, and women who have the highest rates of LITS.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Differential Efficacy of Nicotine Replacement Among Overweight and Obese Women Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Rates of obesity are higher among more dependent smokers and 37%–65% of smokers seeking cessation treatment are overweight or obese. Overweight or obese smokers may possess metabolic and neurobiological features that contribute to difficulty achieving cessation using front-line nicotine replacement products. Attention to factors that facilitate effective cessation treatment in this vulnerable population is needed to significantly reduce mortality risk among overweight and obese smokers. Method: This secondary analysis of 2 large trials of transdermal nicotine replacement in general medical practices evaluated the hypothesis that higher body mass index (BMI) would moderate the efficacy of the nicotine patch. We examined the potential for gender to further moderate the relationship between BMI and treatment efficacy. Results: In the placebo controlled trial (N = 1,621), 21-mg patch was no more effective than placebo for assisting biochemically verified point prevalence abstinence up to 1 year after quitting for women with higher BMI, but appeared to be effective for men at normal or high BMI (gender × BMI beta = −0.22, p = .004). We did not find differential long-term cessation outcomes among male or female smokers in the 15-mg patch trial (n = 705). However, we observed significantly higher rates of early lapse among women with higher BMI treated with nicotine patch across both trials. Conclusion: These results suggest that increased BMI may affect the efficacy of nicotine patch on reducing risk of early lapse in women. Additional research is needed to explore mechanisms of risk for decreased efficacy of this commonly used cessation aid.

This study evaluated a Social Branding intervention, CRUSH, which included an aspirational brand, social events, and targeted media to discourage smoking among LGBT young adults in Las Vegas, NV. Methods: Cross-sectional surveys (N = 2,395) were collected in Las Vegas LGBT bars at 2 time points 1 year apart. Multivariate logistic regressions examined associations between campaign exposure, message understanding, and current (past 30 days) smoking, controlling for demographics. Results: LGBT individuals were significantly more likely to report current (past 30 day) smoking than heterosexual/straight, gender-conforming participants. Overall, 53% of respondents reported exposure to CRUSH; of those exposed, 60% liked the campaign, 60.3% reported they would attend a CRUSH event on a night when they usually went somewhere else, and 86.3% correctly identified that the campaign was about “partying fresh and smokefree.” Current smoking was reported by 47% of respondents at Time 1 and 39.6% at Time 2. There were significant interactions between time and campaign exposure and campaign exposure and understanding the message. Among those who understood the CRUSH smokefree message, the highest level of campaign exposure was significantly associated with 37%–48% lower odds for current smoking. Conclusions: While longitudinal studies would better assess the impact of this intervention, CRUSH shows promise to reduce tobacco use among LGBT bar patrons.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Tobacco Smoking, Nicotine Dependence, and Patterns of Prescription Opioid Misuse: Results From a Nationally Representative Sample",article,['gender'],"Introduction: The misuse of prescription opioid medications is a growing public health crisis. Given evidence of complex nicotine-opioid interactions, and initial support for the role of smoking status as a risk factor for prescription opioid misuse, a more detailed analysis of how current and historical patterns of smoking may influence misuse of prescription opioids is warranted. Methods: The current study is the first to test whether varying levels of current/historical smoking (current daily, current intermittent, former daily, never) and indices of smoking heaviness/nicotine dependence may be associated with greater likelihood of past-year prescription opioid misuse in the general population. Data were derived from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 24,348). Results: Consistent with hypotheses, after accounting for sociodemographic factors and major depressive/alcohol use disorders, both daily and intermittent smokers were greater than 3 times more likely to report past-year nonmedical prescription opioid use than were never smokers. In addition, daily smokers were observed to be nearly 5 times more likely, and intermittent smokers were nearly 3 times more likely, to have met past-year abuse/dependence criteria, relative to never smokers. Results further revealed positive associations between various indices of smoking heaviness/nicotine dependence and opioid medication misuse, and these findings remained largely consistent when analyses were stratified by gender. Conclusions: These findings indicate that smokers are not a homogeneous group with regard to risk for opioid misuse, and support the utility of comprehensive smoking assessment in the context of opioid-based treatment/tapering.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Associations of Weight Concerns With Self-Efficacy and Motivation to Quit Smoking: A Population-Based Study Among Finnish Daily Smokers,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Concerns about weight gain occurring after smoking cessation may affect motivation and self-efficacy towards quitting smoking. We examined associations of smoking-specific weight concerns with smoking cessation motivation and self-efficacy in a population-based cross-sectional sample of daily smokers. Methods: Six-hundred biochemically verified (blood cotinine) current daily smokers comprising 318 men and 282 women aged 25–74 years, were studied as part of the National FINRISK (Finnish Population Survey on Risk Factors on Chronic, Noncommunicable Diseases) study and its DIetary, Lifestyle and Genetic factors in the development of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome (DILGOM) sub-study that was conducted in Finland in 2007. Self-reported scales were used to assess weight concerns, motivation and self-efficacy regarding the cessation of smoking. Multiple regression analyses of concerns about weight in relation to motivation and self-efficacy were conducted with adjustments for sex, age (years), body mass index (BMI, [kg/m2]), physical activity (times per week), and further controlled for nicotine dependence (Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence). Results: Higher levels of weight concerns were associated with lower self-efficacy (β = −0.07, p < .001) after adjusting for sex and age. The association remained after additional adjustment for BMI and physical activity (β = −0.07, p < .001). After further controlling for nicotine dependence the association became weaker but remained significant (β = −0.04, p = .02). There were no statistically significant associations between concerns about weight and motivation for smoking cessation (β = 0.02, p = 0.16). Conclusions: These cross-sectional population-based data do not support earlier findings that suggest that smokers with high levels of weight concerns are less motivated to quit smoking. Our data suggest that daily smokers who are highly concerned about weight may have lower self-efficacy for cessation of smoking.

CU may impact smoking quit rates and confer greater risk of health problems within this vulnerable population. This study characterized CU in a sample of homeless smokers and compared cigarette-only smokers (C-OS) to concurrent users (CUs) on participant characteristics and factors known to be associated with smoking cessation. Methods: Participants were 178 adult conventional cigarette smokers from a homeless shelter in Dallas, TX. Sociodemographic characteristics, number of homelessness episodes, tobacco dependence, and items characterizing use of several tobacco/nicotine products over the last 30 days including use frequency, reasons for use, and perceived health risks were described. Sociodemographic characteristics, number of homelessness episodes, tobacco dependence, stress, readiness to quit (RTQ) smoking, and number of smoking quit attempts in the last year were compared between the C-OS and CUs groups using t tests and chi-square tests. Results: CU was prevalent (n = 91; 51.1%), and 49.5% of CUs reported the use of ≥2 products in addition to conventional cigarettes. Compared with C-OS, CUs were younger and had more homelessness episodes, higher expired breath carbon monoxide levels, and higher stress (ps < .05). Groups did not differ on sex, race, other dependence indicators, RTQ, or previous quit attempts. Conclusions: CU is common among homeless smokers. CUs and C-OS did not differ in their RTQ smoking, though greater stress among the CUs may represent a hurdle for cessation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Varenicline for Smoking Cessation in Light Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction: As the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined, the proportion of smokers who smoke less than 10 cigarettes/day (cpd) has increased. Varenicline may provide an effective pharmacotherapeutic treatment option for increasing smoking abstinence rates among light smokers. Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of varenicline for increasing smoking abstinence rates among light smokers (5–10 cpd). Participants received varenicline or placebo for 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months. Results:  Ninety-three participants were randomized. Fifty-two percent of participants terminated the study early. At end-of-treatment (3 months), the point prevalence smoking abstinence rate was 53.3% in the varenicline group compared to 14.5% in placebo (odds ratio [OR]: 6.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.48–18.06, P < .001), and the prolonged smoking abstinence rate was 40.0% and 8.3%, respectively (OR: 7.33, 95% CI: 2.24–23.98, P = .001). At end-of-study (6 months), the point prevalence smoking abstinence rate was 40.0% in the varenicline group compared to 20.8% in placebo (OR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.01–6.34, P = .047), and the prolonged smoking abstinence rate was 31.1% and 8.3%, respectively (OR: 4.97, 95% CI: 1.49–16.53, P = .009). The estimated magnitude of the treatment effect remained consistent across the various missing data assumptions and in analyses that adjusted for gender. Nausea and sleep disturbance were more commonly reported in the varenicline group.  Conclusions: Varenicline was safe and effective for increasing long-term smoking abstinence rates in a population of predominantly White light cigarette smoker. The efficacy of varenicline in this study was comparable to that observed in heavier smokers. Implications: Our findings demonstrate that varenicline is effective for increasing smoking cessation in light smokers. Our findings have implications for advancing the treatment of light smokers in clinical practice.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Progesterone and Postpartum Smoking Relapse: A Pilot Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Randomized Trial,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Pregnancy is a strong motivator to quit smoking, yet postpartum relapse rates are high. Growing evidence suggests a role of sex hormones in drug abuse behavior and given the precipitous drop in sex hormones at delivery, they may play a role in postpartum relapse. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility and potential role of exogenous progesterone in postpartum smoking relapse. Methods: This 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial randomized 46 abstinent postpartum women to active progesterone (PRO; 200mg twice a day) versus placebo (PBO) for 4 weeks. Participants were followed for relapse for 12 weeks. Main study outcomes include abstinence (point prevalence), feasibility (compliance per number of clinic visits attended, pill counts and Electronic Data Capture [EDC] completed) and self-reported acceptability. Safety was also measured by depressive symptom scores, adverse events, and breastfeeding. Results:  Overall retention rate was 87% at week 12. At week 4, abstinence rates were 75% in the PRO group and 68.2% in the PBO group ( p = .75). Medication adherence was 68% and clinic visit attendance was 80%, with no differences by randomization. Depressive symptom scores, adverse events, and breastfeeding did not vary by randomization.  Conclusions: Although the study was not powered to evaluate abstinence rates, we did observe a higher prevalence of abstinence at week 4 in the PRO group. Further, exogenous progesterone was well tolerated and did not adversely affect depressive symptoms or breastfeeding. Thus, the results of this pilot study indicate further investigation into progesterone as a postpartum relapse prevention strategy is warranted. Implications: This innovative pilot trial determined the feasibility of delivering exogenous progesterone as a potential prevention of postpartum smoking relapse. We observed high retention and moderate adherence rates, as well as high acceptability among participants. Further, though not statistically significant, more women in the treatment group remained abstinent from smoking during follow-up. This project adds to the growing body of literature on the role of sex hormones in smoking relapse and also provides support for a fully powered clinical trial.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Little Cigars and Cigarillos Use Among Young Adult Cigarette Smokers in the United States: Understanding Risk of Concomitant Use Subtypes,article,['gender'],"Introduction: In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would regulate little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs) and expressed concern about the concomitant use of combustible tobacco products. To understand LCC use among socially-disadvantaged cigarette smokers, we assessed (1) the prevalence of concomitant use of subtypes of LCCs: LCC-tobacco, LCC-blunt, and LCC- poly use, which includes use of both LCC-tobacco and LCC-blunt and (2) and its association with sociodemographic factors and substance use behaviors using race/ethnicity and gender stratified models. Methods: In 2015, a web-based survey was administered to a national probability sample of black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and white cigarette smokers aged 18–44 (n = 1018). Weighted estimates were used to assess current LCC-tobacco, LCC-blunt, and LCC-poly use. Multinomial regression models assessed sociodemographic, other tobacco and substance use correlates associated with LCC user subtypes. Results: Of cigarette smokers, 63% did not smoke LCCs; 15.1% were LCC-tobacco users; 11.1% were LCC-blunt users; and 10.5% were LCC-poly users. Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino cigarette smokers had higher odds of LCC-tobacco, LCC-blunt, and LCC-poly use compared to white cigarette smokers. Blacks/African Americans who initiated cigarette smoking before age 18 and smoked other tobacco products had greater odds of LCC-tobacco use than whites. Male cigarette smokers who smoked other tobacco products and females who had early onset of cigarette use also had greater odds of LCC-tobacco use. Conclusions: Over 30% of cigarette smokers concomitantly used LCCs, which may prolong smoking. Accurate estimates of diverse LCC use behaviors may increase our understanding of the potential harms of concomitant use. Implications: Aggregate measures of LCC smoking do not distinguish subtypes of use among socially-disadvantaged cigarette smokers (ie, young adults, blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos), who may engage in these unique smoking behaviors. We document the prevalence of young adult cigarette smokers who dual use LCC-tobacco and LCC-blunts and are poly users of LCC-tobacco + LCC-blunts, and identify sociodemographic groups at risk for use. The Food and Drug Administration is concerned about concomitant behavior, which may increase chronic disease risk and addiction. Accurate estimates of LCC smoking behaviors may increase our understanding of the harms of concomitant use; which can inform prevention programs that specifically target LCC subtypes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,High Prevalence of Smoking in the Roma Population Seems to Have No Genetic Background,article,['gender'],"Introduction: The prevalence of smoking in Romani of both genders is significantly higher than in the general population. Our aim was to determine whether a genetic susceptibility contributes to the high prevalence of smoking among Roma in a study based on data collected from cross-sectional surveys. Methods: Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be closely related to smoking behavior were investigated in DNA samples of Hungarian Roma (N = 1273) and general (N = 2388) populations. Differences in genotype and allele distribution were investigated. Genetic risk scores (GRSs) were generated to estimate the joint effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes COMT, CHRNA3/4/5, CYP2A6, CTNNA3, DRD2, MAOA, KCNJ6, AGPHD1, ANKK1, TRPC7, GABRA4, and NRXN1. The distribution of scores in study populations was compared. Age, gender, and body mass index were considered as confounding factors. Results: Difference in allele frequencies between the study populations remained significant for 16 polymorphisms after multiple test correction (p < .003). Unexpectedly, the susceptible alleles were more common in the general population, although the protective alleles were more prevalent among Roma. The distribution of unweighted GRS in Roma population was left shifted compared to general population (p < .001). Furthermore, the median weighted GRS was lower among the subjects of Roma population compared to the subjects of general population (p < .001) even after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions: The harmful smoking behavior of the Roma population could not be accounted for by genetic susceptibility; therefore, interventions aimed at smoking prevention and cessation should focus on cultural and environmental factors. Implications: This is the first study designed to determine whether genetic background exists behind the harmful behavior of the smoking of the Roma population. Although the frequencies of susceptible and protective alleles strongly differ between the Hungarian Roma and general populations, it is shown that calculated GRSs being significantly higher in the general population, which do not support the hypothesis on the genetic susceptibility of the Roma population. Interventions aimed at smoking cessation in the Roma population should preferentially target cultural and environmental factors.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Factors Associated With Accepting Assistance for Smoking Cessation Among Military Veterans,article,"['gender', 'sex']","Introduction: Cigarette smoking remains a significant health risk for Veterans. Increased understanding of factors that influence the tobacco cessation referral process within Veterans Affairs medical facilities is useful for enhancing utilization of smoking cessation treatment. The present study examined the association of demographic and health variables with whether smokers accepted referral for medication and/or tobacco cessation clinic. Methods: Electronic medical record data (2011–2013) were obtained for a sample of US military Veterans who accepted cessation assistance from their health care provider. Demographic and diagnostic variables were examined to identify predictors of the types of assistance accepted (medication only, clinic referral only, or both). Results: The sample includes 2941 Veterans, 10.3% female, 19.9% African American, 10.7% Hispanic, and 57.9% non-Hispanic white. Veterans averaged of 50.69 years of age (SD = 14.01), 31.5% had a substance use disorder diagnosis and 54.1% had a psychiatric diagnosis. Demographic and diagnostic information was compared across types of assistance accepted. Significant differences were found between those who accepted medications only and those who accepted either clinic referral or both medication and clinic referral. Veterans in the latter two categories were younger and more likely to have a psychiatric diagnosis than those accepting medication only. Women Veterans were significantly more likely than men to accept clinic referral plus medication. However, in contrast to men, almost none of the variables examined were associated with the type of assistance accepted by women. Conclusion: These findings indicate significant gender differences in influences on accepting assistance for smoking cessation among Veterans. Implications: Existing research identifies factors associated with unassisted quitting. However, little is known regarding the referral process, which is critical in connecting smokers with treatment. The present work is unique in employing electronic medical record data to examine factors associated with accepting different types of smoking cessation treatment referrals. This study represents an initial effort to elucidate the smoking cessation treatment referral process. These findings highlight the need to examine sex specific influences on smoking cessation treatment utilization and the importance of focusing on smokers with psychiatric disorders.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Is There a Relationship Between the Concentration of Same-Sex Couples and Tobacco Retailer Density?,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'same-sex', 'sex']","Background: Tobacco use is markedly higher among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations than heterosexuals. Higher density of tobacco retailers is found in neighborhoods with lower income and more racial/ethnic minorities. Same-sex couples tend to live in similar neighborhoods, but the association of this demographic with tobacco retailer density has not been examined. Methods:  For a national sample of 97 US counties, we calculated the number of tobacco retailers per 1000 persons and rates of same-sex couples per 1000 households in each census tract ( n = 17 941). Using spatial regression, we examined the association of these variables in sex-stratified models, including neighborhood demographics and other environmental characteristics to examine confounding.  Results: Results from spatial regression show that higher rates of both female and male same-sex couples were associated with a higher density of tobacco retailers. However the magnitude of this association was small. For female couples, the association was not significant after controlling for area-level characteristics, such as percent black, percent Hispanic, median household income, the presence of interstate highways, and urbanicity, which are neighborhood correlates of higher tobacco retailer density. For male couples, the association persisted after control for these characteristics. Conclusion: Same-sex couples reside in areas with higher tobacco retailer density, and for men, this association was not explained by neighborhood confounders, such as racial/ethnic composition and income. While lesbian, gay, and bisexual disparities in tobacco use may be influenced by neighborhood environment, the magnitude of the association suggests other explanations of these disparities remain important areas of research.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Assessing Trends in Tobacco Cessation in Diverse Patient Populations,article,['gender'],"Introduction: This study examined change in tobacco use over 4 years among the general population of patients in six diverse health care organizations using electronic medical record data. Methods:  The study cohort ( N = 34 393) included all patients age 18 years or older who were identified as smokers in 2007, and who then had at least one primary care visit in each of the following 4 years.  Results:  In the 4 years following 2007, this patient cohort had a median of 13 primary care visits, and 38.6% of the patients quit smoking at least once. At the end of the fourth follow-up year, 15.4% had stopped smoking for 1 year or more. Smokers were more likely to become long-term quitters if they were 65 or older ( OR = 1.32, 95% CI = [1.16, 1.49]), or had a diagnoses of cancer (1.26 [1.12, 1.41]), cardiovascular disease (1.22 [1.09, 1.37]), asthma (1.15 [1.06, 1.25]), or diabetes (1.17 [1.09, 1.27]). Characteristics associated with lower likelihood of becoming a long-term quitter were female gender (0.90 [0.84, 0.95]), black race (0.84 [0.75, 0.94]) and those identified as non-Hispanic (0.50 [0.43, 0.59]).  Conclusions: Among smokers who regularly used these care systems, one in seven had achieved long-term cessation after 4 years. This study shows the practicality of using electronic medical records for monitoring patient smoking status over time. Similar methods could be used to assess tobacco use in any health care organization to evaluate the impact of environmental and organizational programs.

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the associations between transgender-based discrimination and smoking patterns among a sample of transgender women; and (2) to identify barriers to smoking cessation in a sample of transgender women with a history of smoking. Methods: A community sample of 241 transgender women completed a one-time survey. Binary and multinomial logistic regression models examined associations between minority stressors and (1) smoking behaviors and (2) cessation attempts. Both models adjusted for income, education, race/ethnicity, recent sex work, HIV status, depression, alcohol use, and current hormone use. Results:  Overall, 83% of participants indicated that they had smoked a cigarette in the last month. Of these women, 62.3% reported daily smoking and 51.7% reported an unsuccessful quit attempt. Discrimination was positively associated with currently smoking (adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.08). Discrimination was positively associated with unsuccessful cessation ( AOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.18) and never attempting ( AOR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.11) compared to successful cessation. Discrimination was also positively associated with never attempting compared to unsuccessful cessation ( AOR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.03).  Conclusions: Smoking cessation may be driven by unique transgender-related minority stressors, such as discrimination. Future research is warranted to address unique stigmatizing contexts when understanding and providing tailored intervention addressing smoking among transgender women.

This study aimed to identify gender-specific individual and social predictors of cigarette smoking progression among a school-based sample of adolescents in Irbid, Jordan. Methods:  A total of 1781 seventh graders (participation rate 95%) were enrolled and completed an annual self-administered questionnaire from 2008 through 2011. Students who reported “ever-smoking a cigarette” at baseline or in the subsequent follow-up but not being “heavy daily smokers” (>10 cigarettes per day) were eligible for this analysis ( N = 669). Grouped-time survival analyses were used to identify predictors of cigarette smoking progression in boys and girls.  Results: Among the study sample, 38.3% of students increased the frequency and /or amount of cigarette smoking during the 3 years of follow-up. Among individual factors, the urge to smoke in the morning predicted smoking progression for boys and girls. The independent predictors of cigarette smoking progression were friends’ smoking and attending public schools in boys, and siblings’ smoking in girls. Discussing the dangers of smoking with family members was protective for girls. Conclusion: Boys and girls progressed similarly in cigarette smoking once they initiated the habit. Progression among girls was solely family-related, while it was peer-related for boys.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Nicotine Metabolism in Young Adult Daily Menthol and Nonmenthol Smokers,article,"['gender', 'trans']","Introduction: Menthol cigarette smoking may increase the risk for tobacco smoke exposure and inhibit nicotine metabolism in the liver. Nicotine metabolism is primarily mediated by the enzyme CYP2A6 and the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR = trans 3′ hydroxycotinine/cotinine) is a phenotypic proxy for CYP2A6 activity. No studies have examined differences in this biomarker among young adult daily menthol and nonmenthol smokers. This study compares biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure among young adult daily menthol and nonmenthol smokers. Methods:  Saliva cotinine and carbon monoxide were measured in a multiethnic sample of daily smokers aged 18–35 ( n = 186). Nicotine, cotinine, the cotinine/cigarette per day ratio, trans 3′ hydroxycotinine, the NMR, and expired carbon monoxide were compared.  Results:  The geometric means for nicotine, cotinine, and the cotinine/cigarette per day ratio did not significantly differ between menthol and nonmenthol smokers. The NMR was significantly lower among menthol compared with nonmenthol smokers after adjusting for race/ethnicity, gender, body mass index, and cigarette smoked per day (0.19 vs. 0.24, P = .03). White menthol smokers had significantly higher cotinine/cigarettes per day ratio than white nonmenthol smokers in the adjusted model. White menthol smokers had a lower NMR in the unadjusted model (0.24 vs. 0.31, P = .05) and the differences remained marginally significant in the adjusted model (0.28 vs. 0.34, P = .06). We did not observe these differences in Native Hawaiians and Filipinos.  Conclusions: Young adult daily menthol smokers have slower rates of nicotine metabolism than nonmenthol smokers. Studies are needed to determine the utility of this biomarker for smoking cessation treatment assignments.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Nicotine Metabolite Ratio is Associated With Early Smoking Abstinence Even After Controlling for Factors That Influence the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio,article,['sex'],"Introduction:  The decrease in smoking rates in North America has plateaued, underscoring the need for new approaches to treat nicotine dependence. Inter-individual differences in smoking behavior result, in part, from variation in the rate of CYP2A6 -mediated nicotine metabolism. A phenotypic measure of CYP2A6 activity is the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), the ratio of 3′hydroxycotinine/cotinine. The NMR is associated with smoking cessation. However, the NMR is also associated with genetic (eg, CYP2A6 genotype) and other (eg, sex and ethnicity) factors. Here we aimed to determine if previously identified non- CYP2A6 sources of variation in the NMR mitigated the association between the NMR and short-term abstinence.  Methods:  The NMR was determined from blood samples collected at intake from daily smokers aged 18–65. Biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide level ≤ 8 ppm) was measured at 1 week following the target quit date in participants from a smoking cessation clinical trial (NCT01314001). Analyses were restricted to N = 462 blacks and N = 693 whites in the intent-to-treat sample.  Results:  Lower NMR (<0.31) was associated with a higher likelihood of 1-week abstinence ( OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.84). NMR was associated with abstinence even after controlling for treatment arm (nicotine patch or varenicline) and factors previously associated with NMR variation including sex, ethnicity, estrogen-containing hormonal therapy, body mass index, alcohol, and cigarette consumption.  Conclusions: NMR was associated with 1-week smoking abstinence; NMR may be a useful addition to medication screening approaches evaluating treatments for nicotine dependence.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) adults are a vulnerable population that smokes at higher rates than heterosexuals. Methods:  We used data collected from the National Adult Tobacco Survey 2009–2010, a large, nationally representative study using a randomized, national sample of US landline and cellular telephone listings, ( N = 118 590). We compared LGBT adults to their heterosexual counterparts with regard to exposure to advertisements promoting smoking cessation, and awareness and use of tobacco treatment services, including quitlines, smoking cessation classes, health professional counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and medications.  Results: Fewer GBT men, compared to heterosexual men, were aware of the quitline. However, LGBT individuals have similar exposure to tobacco cessation advertising, as well as similar awareness of and use of evidence based cessation methods as compared to heterosexual peers. Conclusions: The similarly of awareness and use of cessation support indicates a need for LGBT-specific efforts to reduce smoking disparities. Potential interventions would include: improving awareness of, access to and acceptability of current cessation methods for LGBT patients, developing tailored cessation interventions, and denormalizing smoking in LGBT community spaces.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Active and Passive Smoking and Serum Total Bilirubin in a Rural Korean Population,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Serum bilirubin is an endogenous antioxidant biomarker and its low level is a potential risk factor for smoking related health disorders. This study investigated the association of cigarette smoke with serum total bilirubin among Koreans. Methods: Between 2006 and 2011, we examined 4899 Korean adults living in a rural community. After excluding 38 participants with serum bilirubin more than 2mg/dL, 75 participants who did not report their smoking status or who had liver or bile duct disorders, and 711 participants with liver enzymes exceeding the upper reference values, we performed a cross-sectional analysis on 4075 participants. Participants were classified into four groups: never-smokers without secondhand smoke exposure (SHSE), never-smokers with SHSE, former smokers, and active smokers. Serum total bilirubin concentration was measured using the enzyme method. Results: Compared to never-smokers without SHSE, never-smokers with SHSE (β = –0.025mg/dL), former smokers (β = –0.049mg/dL), and active smokers (β = –0.149mg/dL) had significantly lower serum bilirubin even after adjusting for demographic factors, study year, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, hemoglobin, lifestyle factors, and chronic diseases. A sex-stratified analysis indicated that for men, former smokers and active smokers were significantly associated with having lower bilirubin when compared to never-smokers without SHSE. However, for women, never-smokers with SHSE and active smokers were significantly associated with having lower bilirubin when compared to never-smokers without SHSE. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both active and passive cigarette smoking are associated with low serum bilirubin among Korean adults. Implications: Our results suggest that not only active smoking but also passive smoking including SHSE can have an influence on decreasing serum bilirubin levels. With this different point of view, our study supports efforts to create smoke-free environments in order to foster more favorable serum bilirubin profiles, which may improve endothelial function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,CYP2A6 Effects on Subjective Reactions to Initial Smoking Attempt,article,['gender'],"Introduction:  In very novice smokers, CYP2A6 genotypes that reduce nicotine metabolism to an intermediate rate may increase smoking risk, relative to both normal and slow rates. The present study examined the hypothesis that intermediate metabolism variants are associated with greater pleasurable effects of the initial smoking attempt than either normal or slow metabolism variants.  Methods:  Participants were novice smokers ( N = 261, 65% female) of European descent. Predicted nicotine metabolic rate based on CYP2A6 diplotypes ( CYP2A6 Diplotype Predicted Rate [CDPR]) was partitioned into Normal, Intermediate, and Slow categories using a metabolism metric. Subjective reactions to the initial smoking attempt were assessed by the Pleasurable Smoking Experiences (PSE) scale, which was collected within 3 years of the initial smoking attempt. The effect of CDPR on PSE was tested using a generalized linear model in which CDPR was dummy coded and Intermediate CDPR was the reference condition. Gender was included in the model as a control for higher PSE scores by males.  Results:  Lower PSE scores were associated with Normal CDPR, β = −0.34, P = .008, and Slow CDPR, β = −0.52, P = .001, relative to Intermediate CDPR.  Conclusions:  Intermediate CDPR-enhanced pleasurable effects of the initial smoking attempt relative to other CYP2A6 variants. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the risk effect of Intermediate CDPR on early smoking is a function of optimal pleasurable effects.  Implications: This study supports our recent hypothesis that CYP2A6 diplotypes that encode intermediate nicotine metabolism rate are associated with enhanced pleasurable events following the initial smoking attempt, compared with diplotypes that encode either normal or slow metabolism. This hypothesis was offered to account for our unexpected previous finding of enhanced smoking risk in very novice smokers associated with intermediate metabolism rate. Our new finding encourages further investigation of time-dependent relations between CYP2A6 effects and smoking motives, and it encourages laboratory study of the mechanisms underlying the initial smoking enhancement in novice smokers associated with intermediate metabolism.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Sociodemographic Differences in the Use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems in the European Union,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are rapidly increasing in popularity. However, little is known about sociodemographic differences in use of ENDS. This study aims to assess the sociodemographic characteristics associated with ENDS ever-use and use as a cessation tool in the European Union. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2012 Eurobarometer wave 77.1, with 25 922 respondents aged 15 years or above from all 27 member states. We estimated the prevalence of ever-use and use as a cessation tool, and performed binary logistic regression to analyze associations with sociodemographic characteristics. Results:  Overall, 7.2% reported having ever used ENDS. Of all smokers who ever tried to quit, 7.0% used ENDS. Ever-use was inversely associated with being older than 34 years (odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–0.76 for 35–44 years, and OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.25–0.46 for at least 65 years), and positively associated with being higher educated ( OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.22–1.84) or a student ( OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.77–3.08). ENDS were more often used to quit smoking by students ( OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.10–3.82), and were less likely to be used by those aged 65 or older ( OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.15–0.61). No significant differences were found according to sex, social class, marital status or type of community.  Conclusions: In 2012, ever-use of ENDS was low in the European population in general. However, younger people or those with a high education used ENDS more frequently. These results indicate a need for more appropriate product information targeted at these groups. Implications: This study shows that in the European Union in 2012, regular use of ENDS was rare, especially among nonsmokers. Only age and education were strongly associated with ENDS use. The increased prevalence of ever-use among the younger age groups is relevant, as in this age group smoking habits are established. The higher ever-use of ENDS among younger and higher educated people found in this study indicates a need to target appropriate product information, stressing that ENDS use does not imply zero harm.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Polytobacco Use of Cigarettes, Cigars, Chewing Tobacco, and Snuff Among US Adults",article,['gender'],"Introduction: Tobacco use prevalence has been commonly estimated on a product by product basis and the extent of polytobacco use among current users of each tobacco product is not well understood. This study aimed to examine the prevalence, trends, and correlates of polytobacco use among current users of cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff in US adults aged ≥18. Methods:  We used pooled data from the 1998, 2000, 2005, and 2010 Cancer Control Supplements of the National Health Interview Survey ( N = 123 399 adults). Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to determine significant factors associated with polytobacco use.  Results: In 2010, the prevalence of polytobacco use was 8.6% among current cigarette smokers, 50.3% among current cigar users, 54.8% among current chewing tobacco users, and 42.5% among current snuff users. After controlling for other covariates, gender and race/ethnicity did not show consistent associations with poly-use across these four groups of current tobacco users; however, a positive association of young adulthood, less than high school education, and binge drinking with poly-use was consistently found among all these groups. Conclusions: Polytobacco use is extremely popular among current users of non-cigarette tobacco products. Polytobacco use patterns differ across sociodemographic subpopulations, and the gender and racial/ethnic profiles in poly-users vary across different groups of current tobacco users. Tobacco control strategies need to consider the interrelationships in the use of different tobacco products and the diverse profiles of poly-users in order to develop tailored tobacco prevention and intervention policies to further reduce the burden of tobacco use.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Individual, Parental, and Environmental Correlates of Cigar, Cigarillo, and Little Cigar Use Among Middle School Adolescents",article,['gender'],"Introduction: Youth use of cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars (CCLC) is increasing. While correlates of cigarette smoking have been well documented, use of CCLC is not as well understood among young adolescents. This study assessed whether smoking beliefs, parenting practices, and environmental exposures were associated with CCLC use among 7th to 8th grade youth in an urban, mid-Western city. Methods: The Cleveland Youth Risk Behavior Survey was conducted with 7th to 8th grade students in spring 2012. CCLC use was assessed by asking if students had smoked CCLC in the past 30 days. Covariates include self-reported gender, race, grade, acceptability of smoking, parental monitoring, hours of self-care, visits to corner stores, and current cigarette smoking. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine associations with current CCLC use. Results: Overall, 14.3% of youth reported current CCLC use. Students reporting higher acceptability of smoking, lower parental monitoring, longer periods of self-care, more visits to corner stores and current cigarette smoking were more likely to report current CCLC use in both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Conclusions: CCLC use is associated with multiple levels of influence, indicating that prevention of youth CCLC use must utilize a multilevel approach. Increased utilization of corner stores was associated with higher odds of CCLC use, and could indicate that youth stopping at corner stores may be exposed to increased tobacco retail advertising and tobacco products. The findings of this study have implications for FDA regulation to prevent CCLC initiation among youth. Implications: While correlates of cigarette smoking have been well documented, use of CCLC is not as well understood among young adolescents. This is the first study that has examined the association between individual, family, and environmental characteristics and CCLC use. The results of this study illustrate that youth attitudes, perceived parenting practices, and environmental exposure are associated with adolescent CCLC use. This is important as the tobacco control community begins to identify strategies to prevent and reduce CCLC use. The findings of this study have clear implications for FDA regulation to prevent CCLC initiation among youth.

We sought to understand US adults’ awareness and use of DTPs. Methods:  A nationally representative sample of US adults (age ≥ 18 years, N = 17 522) completed an online survey in March 2013 assessing their awareness and use of DTPs.  Results: Approximately 16% of all respondents were aware of DTPs. Few reported ever using DTPs (1.6%). DTP awareness among all respondents was greatest among males, younger adults, current and former smokers, never married respondents, blacks and Latinos, and those who used other ATPs. Among current smokers, DTP awareness was greatest for males, younger adults, blacks and Latinos, those who used other ATPs, and Southerners. DTP use among all respondents was greatest among males, younger adults, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) respondents, former and current smokers, and those who used other ATPs. Among current smokers, DTP use was greatest among males, younger adults, LGBT respondents, those who used other ATPs, those who intended to quit, and those who received medical advice to quit. Conclusions: DTP awareness and use have increased since 2009. DTPs are being used as smoking cessation aids thereby increasing risk of polytobacco use. Medical professionals should emphasize use of empirically-supported smoking cessation aids when advising patients to quit. Regulations are needed to prevent tobacco company promotion of DTPs as smoking cessation aids and to inform consumers of the risks associated with DTPs and polytobacco use. Increased national surveillance of DTP use is recommended. ",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntv212,"Cabrera-Nguyen, E.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Associations of Adolescents’ Cigarette, Waterpipe, and Dual Tobacco Use With Parental Tobacco Use",article,['sex'],"Introduction: Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of parental (both mother and father) cigarette smoking on adolescents’ cigarette smoking. Little is known, however, about how parental tobacco use is related to waterpipe and dual waterpipe/cigarette use, which is increasing dramatically in the Arab countries. Methods:  Study data ( n = 34 788, N = 6 109 572) were obtained from nationally representative Global Youth Tobacco Surveys in 17 Arab countries. Study outcome was adolescents’ tobacco use categorized into none, cigarette smoking only, waterpipe smoking (WPS) only, and dual use. Primary exposure included parental tobacco use categorized into 10 groups—maternal (mother) cigarette smoking only, maternal WPS only, maternal dual use, paternal (father) cigarette smoking only, paternal WPS only, paternal dual use, parental (both mother and father) cigarette smoking only, parental WPS only, parental dual use, and none. Weighted multinomial regression models were conducted to assess the relationships.  Results:  Adolescents reported smoking WPS only (5.7%), cigarettes only (2.9%), and dual use (3.5%). Compared to adolescent with no exposure to parental tobacco use, adolescent exposure to parental dual use was associated with significant increase in WPS only ( OR = 6.08, 95% CI = 2.38–15.51) and dual use ( OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 1.43–10.43). Effect modification of the relationship by adolescents’ sex was observed.  Conclusions: This is the first study to examine adolescent cigarette, waterpipe, and dual use with parental tobacco use. Study findings may help development of cessation interventions targeting parental tobacco use to prevent the rising waterpipe and dual use strain of the global tobacco epidemic. Implications: (1) Influence of parents’ cigarette smoking on adolescents’ smoking has been demonstrated in earlier studies, however, little is known about how tobacco use behaviors of mother and father influences an adolescent’s cigarette, waterpipe and dual cigarette/waterpipe use. (2) Associations of parental (both mother and father) tobacco use with adolescents’ tobacco use differed significantly if the adolescent is a waterpipe smoker or dual user compared to an adolescent cigarette smoker. (3) Adolescents’ exposed to their mothers’ WPS or dual use were more likely to be a waterpipe smoker or dual user. High likelihood of adolescents’ cigarette, waterpipe and dual use is found in homes where parental tobacco use is rampant with both parents smoking either cigarette, waterpipe or both.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Examining the Effects of Parental Influence on Adolescent Smoking Behaviors: A Multilevel Analysis of the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (2003–2011),article,['gender'],"Introduction: Based on a large cross-national dataset, we investigated the role of parental smoking (a risk factor) and parental supervision (a protective factor) on the frequency of smoking by youths in resource-poor countries. In addition, we tested for cross-level interactions between these two predictors and national wealth on the outcome variable. Methods: Pooled cross-sectional data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (2003–2011) were analyzed, which consists of 58956 students in 31 countries. Hierarchical linear models were estimated to examine the associations between the two parental influence variables and adolescent smoking. Results: Among the control variables, age, gender (male), the experience of being bullied, frequency of getting into physical fights, truancy, and anxiety were significantly related to higher frequency of smoking. With respect to the main predictors, both at the individual level, parental supervision was negatively associated with adolescent smoking, while parental smoking was positively related to it. Two cross-level interaction terms were also observed. National wealth (GDP per capita) significantly moderated, that is, increased, these effects of parental influence on how often the adolescents smoked. Conclusions: We provided new evidence on the factors related to adolescent smoking in low-income countries, a topic that has received very little attention. We showed that the associations between parental influences and adolescent smoking behaviors are not constant but vary according to the level of economic development. Future research should incorporate this comparative dimension in elaborating and specifying the conditions under which parental influences and other predictors differentially affect adolescent smoking. Implications: Prior research on adolescent smoking focused on developed countries. Based on the secondary analysis of the Global School-based Student Health Survey (2003–2011), this study examines the associations between parental influence (parental smoking and parental supervision) on the frequency of youth smoking behaviors in resource-poor countries. We show that parental smoking is positively related to adolescent smoking, while parental supervision is negatively related to it. We also find that these two associations vary according to national wealth: both effects are stronger in a country with higher per capita GDP.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Sex Differences in Varenicline Efficacy for Smoking Cessation: A Meta-Analysis,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Women have lower rates of quitting than men with both bupropion and nicotine replacement. It is unknown whether varenicline demonstrates differential efficacy for men and women. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first comprehensive meta-analysis of clinical trial data examining sex differences in the efficacy of varenicline for smoking cessation. Methods:  Searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO, 17 of 43 clinical trials of varenicline for smoking cessation published through December 31, 2014 were low-bias randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Data ( n = 6710 smokers, 34% female, n = 16 studies, 96% of available data) was analyzed with Metafor program in R. Outcome endpoints were 7-day point-prevalence (PP) and continuous-abstinence (CA) at week 12 (end of treatment), week 24 (6-month follow-up), and week 52 (12-month follow-up).  Results:  Using placebo, women were less likely than men to quit (PP-12, CA-24; P < .05 for sex). Using varenicline, similar rates of abstinence for men and women were demonstrated for all six outcomes (eg, PP-12 abstinence rates were 53% in both women and men). Varenicline versus placebo outcomes demonstrated that varenicline was more effective for women for short and intermediate outcomes (PP-12, CA-12, CA-24; P < .05 sex × medication interaction). For end-of-treatment PP, varenicline was 46% more effective for women. For continuous abstinence, varenicline was 34% (CA-12) and 31% (CA-24) more effective for women.  Conclusions: Unlike other smoking cessation medications, varenicline demonstrated greater efficacy among women smokers for short and immediate-term outcomes and equal efficacy for 1-year outcomes. Varenicline may be particularly useful for reducing the sex disparity typically seen in rates of smoking cessation. Implications: Varenicline is currently the most effective FDA-approved smoking cessation medication and this is the first demonstration that women compared with men have a preferred therapeutic response for a smoking cessation medication when considering short-term outcomes. Importantly, this is also the first demonstration that women have similar rates of quitting to men when considering longer-term, 1-year outcomes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Response Parameters for SMS Text Message Assessments Among Pregnant and General Smokers Participating in SMS Cessation Trials,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Despite a substantial increase in use of SMS text messages for collecting smoking-related data, there is limited knowledge on the parameters of response. This study assessed response rates, response speed, impact of reminders and predictors of response to text message assessments among smokers. Methods:  Data were from two SMS cessation intervention trials using clinical samples of pregnant ( n = 198) and general smokers ( n = 293) sent text message assessments during 3-month cessation programs. Response rates were calculated using data from the host web-server. Changes in response over time, impact of reminders and potential demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, parity, and deprivation) and smoking (nicotine dependence, determination to quit, prenatal smoking history, smoking status at follow-up) predictors of response were analyzed.  Results:  Mean response rates were 61.9% (pregnant) and 67.8% (general) with aggregated median response times of 0.35 (pregnant) and 0.64 (general) hours. Response rate reduced over time ( P = .003) for general smokers only. Text message reminders had a significant effect on response ( P s < .001), with observed mean increases of 13.8% (pregnant) and 17.7% (general). Age (odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–1.00) and deprivation ( OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–1.00) weakly predicted response among pregnant smokers and nonsmoking status at 4 weeks follow-up ( OR = 8.63, 95% CI 3.03–24.58) predicted response among general smokers.  Conclusions: Text message assessments within trial-based cessation programs yield rapid responses from a sizable proportion of smokers, which can be increased using text reminders. While few sources of nonresponse bias were identified for general smokers, older and more deprived pregnant women were less likely to respond. Implications: This study demonstrates that most pregnant and general smokers enrolled in a cessation trial will respond to a small number of questions about their smoking sent by text message, mostly within 1 hour of being sent the assessment text message. For those who do not initially respond, our findings suggest that 24- and 48-hour text message reminders are likely to increase response a small but meaningful amount. However, older age and higher deprivation among pregnant smokers and relapse among general smokers is likely to reduce the chance of response.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Mortality Attributable to Secondhand Smoke Exposure in Spain (2011),article,['sex'],"Introduction: The objective of this study was to assess the mortality attributable to secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among never-smokers in Spain in 2011, after the implementation of the Spanish smoking law. Methods: Data on SHS exposure were obtained from a computer-assisted telephone survey carried out in a representative sample of the adult Spanish population. We included the two main diseases widely associated with SHS exposure: lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease. The relative risks for these diseases were selected from previously published meta-analyses. The number of deaths attributable to SHS was calculated by applying the population attributable fraction to mortality not attributable to active smoking in 2011. The analyses were stratified by sex, age and setting of exposure (home, workplace, and both combined). In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed for distinct scenarios. Results: In 2011, a total of 586 deaths in men and 442 deaths in women would be attributable to SHS exposure. The total number of deaths from lung cancer attributable to SHS exposure would be 124, while the total number of deaths from ischaemic heart disease would be 904. The inclusion of ex-smokers or SHS exposure in leisure time in the study would considerably increase the total number of attributable deaths (by 20% and 130%, respectively). Conclusions: The total number of deaths attributable to SHS exposure at home and at work in Spain would be 1028 in 2011. Efforts are still needed to reduce the current prevalence of exposure—mainly due to exposure in nonregulated settings such as homes or cars and some outdoor spaces—and the associated morbidity and mortality.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Recall and Effectiveness of Messages Promoting Smoke-Free Policies in Rural Communities,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Low-cost media campaigns increase demand for smoke-free policies in underserved rural areas. The study examined the impact of loss- and gain-framed smoke-free print ads on recall and perceived effectiveness in rural communities, controlling for personal characteristics. Methods: Following 6- to 9-month print media campaigns in three rural counties, recall and perceived effectiveness of loss-framed (ie, targeting dangers of secondhand smoke [SHS]) and gain-framed (ie, highlighting positive aspects of smoke-free air) ads were assessed using random-digit-dial phone surveys. Respondents were asked if they remembered each ad, whether they liked it, whether they were prompted to contact a smoke-free coalition, whether the ad made them think, and whether it prompted emotion. Mixed modeling assessed whether personal factors predicted ad recall or perceived effectiveness. Results: Loss-framed ads were less likely to be recalled but more likely to prompt emotion. For ads of both frame types, females reported greater recall and perceived effectiveness than males. Those with less education reported higher perceived effectiveness of the ads but lower recall. Nonsmokers were more likely than smokers to perceive the ads as effective. Knowledge of SHS risk and support for smoke-free workplaces were positively associated with recall and effectiveness. Conclusions: Ad recall and perceived effectiveness were associated with framing and demographic and personal characteristics. Smoke-free efforts in rural areas may be bolstered by continuing to promote benefits of smoke-free workplace policies and educate on SHS risks. Rural areas may need to provide a combination of ad types and framing strategies to appeal to a wide audience. Implications: Rural communities are disproportionately affected by SHS and less likely to be protected by smoke-free policies. This study adds evidence-based guidance for tailoring rural smoke-free media campaigns using different framing: gain-framed messages (ie, benefits of smoke-free environments) to promote recall and loss-framed content (ie, dangers of SHS) to prompt emotion. Further, gain-framed messages that are localized to the rural community may be especially effective. Findings support designing smoke-free campaigns in rural communities with the audience in mind by tailoring messages to age, sex, and education level.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Is There any Gender Difference for Smoking Persistence or Relapse Following Diagnosis or Hospitalization for Coronary Heart Disease? Evidence From a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Persistent smoking in patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD) has a significant effect on morbidity and mortality. Although there has been considerable debate around gender differences in smoking cessation, conclusive evidence on how gender impacts rates of smoking cessation and/or relapse following CHD diagnosis is lacking. Aims and Methods: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that female smokers with CHD were more likely to persist in smoking or relapse post-diagnosis or hospitalization than male smokers. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases for studies published in the last 10 years. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model. Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The aggregated sample size was 36 591, 20 617 (56%) were smokers of which 2564 (12%) were female. Meta-analyses of eight studies where smoking prevalence could be measured, showed that females were less likely to be smokers at baseline than males (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.70). Overall, one in two (47%) smokers persisted in smoking/relapsed following a diagnosis or hospitalization for CHD; but there was no gender difference in the rate of persistent smoking/relapse (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.95 to 1.21). Conclusions: Female smokers with CHD were relatively uncommon in the included study populations. However, the rate of persistent smoking/relapse was high in both female and male smokers following a diagnosis or hospitalization for CHD. Therefore similar, sustained smoking cessation efforts are warranted for both genders. Implications: There was no gender difference for persistent smoking/relapse following a diagnosis or hospitalization for CHD, but the rate was high in both female and male smokers. Therefore, similar, sustained smoking cessation efforts are warranted for both genders.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Gender Differences in Smoking Behavior and Dependence Motives Among Daily and Nondaily Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction: While the overall prevalence of smoking has declined, nondaily smoking is on the rise. Among daily smokers (DS) men tend to smoke more cigarettes per day and have higher dependence. Unfortunately little is known about gender differences in nondaily smokers (NDS). Methods: This secondary-data analysis utilized data from a cross-sectional online survey. Participants reported on smoking behavior (eg, cigarettes per day, history of quit attempts) and nicotine dependence motives as assessed by the Brief Wisconsin Inventory of Dependence Motives via the primary and secondary subscales (ie, core features of tobacco dependence such as craving and accessory motives such as weight control, respectively). Results: Participants were 1175 DS (60% women) and 1201 NDS (56% women). Two interactions between group and gender were noted suggesting that the NDS had greater gender differences in past quit attempts (P < .01) and reported change in smoking behavior over the past year (P < .01). Further, among the NDS group, men scored significantly higher than women on both the primary and secondary dependence motives subscales (3.6±0.1 vs. 2.9±0.1, P < .0001; 3.8±0.1 vs. 3.3±0.1, P < .0001; respectively). There were no significant differences in dependence motives in the DS group (P > .05). Conclusions: Gender differences in smoking behavior and dependence motives varied between NDS and DS. Specifically, gender differences in smoking behavior and smoking dependence motives may be larger among NDS compared to DS. Additional research is needed to explore how these relationships may relate to smoking cessation in NDS.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Association of Pain With Smoking and Quit Attempts in an Electronic Diary Study of Cancer Patients Trying to Quit,article,['gender'],"Introduction: The purpose of this electronic daily diary study was to examine the relation of pain to smoking and quit attempts among 34 cancer patients with pain enrolled in a smoking cessation program. Methods: Electronic daily diary assessments of pain and smoking were collected at the end of each day for a 2-week period during smoking cessation treatment. Pain experienced throughout the day was measured on a scale from 1 to 5, from “no pain” to “pain as bad as you can imagine.” Smoking was defined as the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Results: Linear multilevel modeling was used in examining associations between pain and smoking. A within-person pain and smoking association was found, such that greater daily pain was linked to greater daily smoking within individuals, controlling for baseline symptoms, nicotine dependence, smoking urge, age, and gender. No between-person pain and smoking association was observed. Additionally, cancer patients with higher average pain across the 2-week assessment period were less likely to make a quit attempt (defined as a day on which participants smoked no cigarettes) during the study period. Conclusions: The findings of this study add to a nascent literature on pain and smoking by providing initial evidence that pain may be a barrier to quitting among cancer patients who smoke and have pain. Future research examining the effectiveness of integrated pain and smoking cessation treatment in this population may be warranted.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Trends in Smoking Rates by Level of Psychological Distress—Time Series Analysis of US National Health Interview Survey Data 1997–2014,article,['sex'],"Introduction: People with mental health problems have high rates of smoking, and represent a large proportion of adult smokers in the United States. However, few public health programs in tobacco control address mental health. This study sought to determine if smoking is declining at comparable rates in people with different levels of psychological distress. Methods: Time series analysis of smoking prevalence between 1997 and 2014 was undertaken, by level of psychological distress, age group, and sex using data from the US National Health Interview Survey, a series of cross-sectional surveys. Exponential smoothing and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling were used to estimate trends over time. Results: Smoking prevalence has declined steadily in adults with no psychological distress. In males the smoking rate has dropped from 24.4% in 1997 to 16.6% in 2014 in the underlying trend series, a decline of 0.46 percentage points per year (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43–0.48), and in females from 18.4% to 11.3%, a decline of 0.42 percentage points per year (95% CI: 0.39–0.45). In males with high psychological distress there was a much smaller and statistically nonsignificant reduction of 0.08 percentage points per year (95% CI: −0.26–0.42) from 45.6% in 1997 to 44.9% in 2014, while in females the annual rate of decline was 0.29 percentage points (95% CI: −0.11–0.47) representing a smaller decline from 42.0% in 1997 to 37.7% in 2014. Conclusions: People with high levels of psychological distress continue to smoke at particularly high rates, and may benefit less from existing tobacco control measures. Implications: Rates of smoking have declined substantially over time in people with no or low levels of psychological distress and much smaller reductions have occurred in people with high levels of psychological distress. If this trend continues the disparity in smoking rates by levels of psychological distress will continue to rise. These results suggest people with high levels of psychological distress do not benefit to the same extent as others from existing tobacco control measures. Psychological distress and mental illness may be important considerations for future tobacco control efforts.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Intragroup Variance in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Tobacco Use Behaviors: Evidence That Subgroups Matter, Notably Bisexual Women",article,"['bisexual', 'bisexuals', 'gay', 'gender', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'lgb', 'non-lgb']","Introduction: Emerging evidence suggests bisexual populations are at increased risk for a variety of negative health outcomes, including tobacco use. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations are at increased risk for cigarette smoking, but research on LGB subpopulations’ use of tobacco products beyond cigarettes and tobacco use differences across LGB subgroups is in its infancy. This study explores differences in use of tobacco products across LGB subgroups, including gender differences among bisexuals. Methods: This study reports results from a 2013 nationally-representative cross-sectional online survey of US adults (N = 17 087). Weighted tobacco use prevalence and adjusted logistic regression results are reported. Results: LGB populations reported higher current use of any tobacco product (35.7%) and current use of cigarettes (32.0%), e-cigarettes (8.9%), regular (5.5%) and small cigars (11.6%), compared with non-LGB. Bisexual (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7–3.9) and lesbian (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0–2.7) women have higher odds of any tobacco use than heterosexual women; including greater odds of regular (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.2–7.0 and OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3–3.9; respectively) and small cigar use (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.4–4.1 and OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 2.0–5.1; respectively). Gay men had lower odds of cigar use (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2–0.8) than heterosexual men. Conclusions: This is the first US adult population study to assess differences in use of various tobacco products across adult LGB subpopulations and by gender, confirming their increased risk of use and illuminating differences by subgroup and gender. Exploring LGB as a unified population appears inadequate to accurately characterize LGB tobacco use risk. Tobacco-related LGB health inequities, particularly among bisexual and lesbian women, may be greater than previously indicated. Implications: This manuscript provides important contributions to the field of tobacco control and prevention, and more specifically to LGB tobacco-related health disparities research. This is among the first population level studies to explore various tobacco use across LGB populations and across genders, comparing results to non-LGB populations in a national study. We provide novel evidence that bisexual women in particular, have a higher risk for use of various tobacco products, compared with other LGB subpopulations. In order to address this disparity, tobacco control professionals need to be made aware of these important differences in tobacco use behavior.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Structural Discrimination is Associated With Smoking Status Among a National Sample of Transgender Individuals,article,"['gender', 'gender identity', 'transgender']","Introduction: Limited evidence suggests that transgender individuals smoke at significantly higher rates than the general population. We aimed to determine whether structural or everyday discrimination experiences predict smoking behavior among transgender individuals when sociodemographic, health, and gender-specific factors were controlled. Methods: Data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 4781), a cross-sectional online and paper survey distributed to organizations serving the transgender community, were analyzed in order to determine the association between current smoking and discrimination experiences and other potential predictors. Logistic regression models were used to establish factors that predict smoking. Results: Participants reported experiencing both structural (80.4%) and everyday (65.9%) discrimination. Multivariate analyses showed that participants who reported attending some college, graduating college, or having a graduate degree were less likely to smoke compared to those with a high school degree or less. Uninsured participants were more likely to report smoking compared to those with private insurance. Those who used alcohol or drugs for coping were also more likely to smoke. Participants whose IDs and records listed their preferred gender were less likely to smoke (OR = 0.84); those who had experienced structural discrimination were more like to report smoking (OR = 1.65). Conclusions: Further research is needed in order to explore the relationship between smoking and legal transition among transgender individuals. Strategies to prevent smoking and encourage cessation among this vulnerable population are also needed. In addition, comprehensive collection of gender identity data in the context of national surveys, tobacco-related research, and clinical settings is sorely needed. Implications: This study establishes a link between experiences of structural discrimination among transgender individuals and smoking status.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Associations Between Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Inflammation, and Progression of Carotid Atherosclerosis Among Smokers",article,['sex'],"Introduction: The high risk of cardiovascular events in smokers requires adequate control of other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) to curtail atherosclerosis progression. However, it is unclear which CVRFs have the most influence on atherosclerosis progression in smokers. Methods: In 260 smokers aged 40–70 included in a smoking cessation trial, we analyzed the association between traditional CVRFs, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), smoking cessation and 3-year progression of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT, assessed by repeated ultrasound measurements) in a longitudinal multivariate model. Results: Participants (mean age 52 years, 47% women) had a mean smoking duration of 32 years with a median daily consumption of 20 cigarettes. Baseline CIMT was 1185 μm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1082–1287) and increased by 93 μm (95% CI: 25–161) and 108 μm (95% CI: 33–183) after 1 and 3 years, respectively. Age, male sex, daily cigarette consumption, systolic blood pressure (SBP), but neither low-density lipoprotein cholesterol nor hs-CRP, were independently associated with baseline CIMT (all P ≤ .05). Baseline SBP, but neither low-density lipoprotein cholesterol nor hs-CRP, was associated with 3-year atherosclerosis progression (P = .01 at 3 years). The higher the SBP at baseline, the steeper was the CIMT increase over 3-year follow-up. We found an increase of 26 μm per each 10-mmHg raise in SBP at 1 year and an increase of 39 μm per each 10 mmHg raise in SBP at 3 years. Due to insufficient statistical power, we could not exclude an effect of smoking abstinence on CIMT progression. Conclusion: Control of blood pressure may be an important factor to limit atherosclerosis progression in smokers, besides support for smoking cessation. Implications: Among 260 smokers aged 40–70 years with a mean smoking duration of 32 years, baseline SBP was associated with atherosclerosis progression over 3 years, as measured by CIMT (P = .01 at 3 years), independently of smoking variables and other CVRFs. The higher the SBP at baseline, the steeper was the CIMT increase over 3-year follow-up. Our findings emphasize the importance of focusing not only on smoking cessation among smokers, but to simultaneously control other CVRFs, particularly blood pressure, in order to prevent future cardiovascular disease.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Risk-Continuum Categorization of Product Use Among US Youth Tobacco Users,article,['gender'],"Introduction: To examine prevalence and correlates of five mutually exclusive tobacco-use patterns among US youth tobacco users. Methods:  A nationally representative sample of tobacco users ( N = 3202, 9–17 years) was classified into five product-use patterns. Weighted multinominal and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine prevalence of product-use patterns by gender, race and ethnicity, and grade level; and associations between product-use patterns and perceived accessibility of tobacco products, exposure and receptivity to pro-tobacco marketing, social benefits of smoking, and tobacco-associated risks.  Results:  Dual use (ie, use of two product categories) was the most prevalent pattern (30.5%), followed by non-cigarette combustible only (26.7%), polytobacco (ie, use of three product categories; 17.5%), cigarette only (14.9%), and noncombustible only (10.4%) use. Product-use patterns differed by gender, race, and ethnicity. Compared to cigarette only users, dual and polytobacco users were more likely to be exposed to and be receptive to pro-tobacco marketing, and were less likely to acknowledge tobacco-use related risks ( P s < .05).  Conclusions: Curbing tobacco use warrants research on users of more than one tobacco-product categories according to the risk-continuum categorization. Implications: We present a risk-continuum categorization of product-use patterns among tobacco users not older than 17 years. We classify tobacco users into five mutually exclusive product-use patterns: cigarette only users, non-cigarette combustible only users, noncombustible only users, dual use, and polytobacco use. This categorization overcomes limitations in current literature on tobacco-use patterns, which include exclusion of certain products (eg, e-cigarettes) and product-use patterns (eg, exclusive users of non-cigarette products), and inconsistent classification of tobacco users. It is parsimonious yet complex enough to retain differential characteristics of sub-tobacco users based on number (single, dual, polytobacco) and categories (cigarettes, non-cigarette combustibles, noncombustibles) of tobacco products consumed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Risk Profiles of Youth Single, Dual, and Poly Tobacco Users",article,['gender'],"Introduction: Given widespread availability and uptake of myriad tobacco products among youth, a comprehensive tobacco control agenda necessitates an in-depth exploration of the phenomenon of concurrent tobacco use. Methods:  Multinomial logistic regression generated distinct concurrent tobacco use risk profiles of single, dual, and poly use, defined as use of only one, only two, and any three or more tobacco products in the last 30 days, from the 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey ( n = 24 658).  Results:  Among youth using tobacco in the past 30 days ( n = 5030), the majority were poly tobacco product users (55.9%, n = 2813), followed by single (28.4%, n = 1406), and dual users (16.1%, n = 811). Multivariable models showed higher levels of nicotine dependence among poly users compared to single (relative risk ratio [ RRR ] = 3.14, P < .001) and dual users ( RRR = 2.48, P < .001). Poly users were less likely to express quit intent compared to single ( RRR = 0.68, P < .01) or dual users ( RRR = 0.77, P < .05). Tobacco harm perceptions were more likely among dual users relative to single product users ( RRR = 1.54, P < .05); poly users were less likely to perceive harm ( RRR = 0.56, P < .001). Racial and gender differences also emerged.  Conclusion: As the number of tobacco products increased, nicotine dependence and perceived tobacco use among peers increased, whereas quit intentions decreased. Dual users had greater tobacco harm perceptions than poly and single users and higher prevalence of electronic cigarette use. Results suggest that poly use may be driven by addiction whereas dual use may be motivated by intentions to quit. Focused risk assessments may inform tailored interventions for distinct types of tobacco users. Implications: This study provides an in-depth look at the risks for concurrent tobacco use among youth by creating unique risk profiles for single, dual and poly use. Results from this study can inform tailored interventions for distinct types of tobacco users.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Oxidative Stress in Youth and Adolescents With Elevated Body Mass Index Exposed to Secondhand Smoke,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Our objective was to investigate the relationships between secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and oxidative stress in a group of youth and adolescents with elevated body mass index. Methods: Participants in this cross sectional study were healthy nonsmoking youth and adolescents ages 9 to 18 years old. Three-quarters of the participants were either overweight or obese. SHS exposure was determined by survey and hair nicotine level. Markers of oxidation were total antioxidant capacity and protein malondialdehyde adducts (MDA). Results:  Ninety subjects were studied; adequate hair samples were available for 86. The mean hair nicotine level was 0.75ng/mg, the median was 0.58ng/mg and the range was 0.09–2.88ng/mg. There was a significant relationship between MDA and the three survey questions regarding smoke exposure ([mother smokes, r = 0.29, P = .006], [smoker lives in the home, r = 0.31, P = .004], and [number of smokers in the home, r = 0.36, P = .002]). There was a significant positive relationship between log-hair nicotine and MDA (Pearson r = 0.233, P = .031), which remained significant after controlling for age, sex, race, and method of insurance. No relationship was found between log-hair nicotine and total antioxidant capacity. However, there was a significant relationship between number of smokers in the home ( r = 0.24, P = .042) and total antioxidant capacity.  Conclusions: We have demonstrated a significant positive relationship hair nicotine level and MDA in a group of youth with a high proportion of overweight/obese subjects. Implications: We have shown a significant relationship between objectively measured SHS exposure and one marker of oxidative stress in a sample of youth and adolescents with a high proportion of overweight/obese subjects, and who were nonsmokers with relatively low tobacco exposure. This finding remains significant after controlling for age, sex, race, and type of medical insurance. Since the cardiovascular effects of SHS exposure are related to oxidative stress, this finding adds to our knowledge that the sequence of deleterious effects of tobacco exposure on the cardiovascular system begins long before clinical disease is evident.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Has Childhood Smoking Reduced Following Smoke-Free Public Places Legislation? A Segmented Regression Analysis of Cross-Sectional UK School-Based Surveys,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Smoke-free legislation has been a great success for tobacco control but its impact on smoking uptake remains under-explored. We investigated if trends in smoking uptake amongst adolescents differed before and after the introduction of smoke-free legislation in the United Kingdom. Methods: Prevalence estimates for regular smoking were obtained from representative school-based surveys for the four countries of the United Kingdom. Post-intervention status was represented using a dummy variable and to allow for a change in trend, the number of years since implementation was included. To estimate the association between smoke-free legislation and adolescent smoking, the percentage of regular smokers was modeled using linear regression adjusted for trends over time and country. All models were stratified by age (13 and 15 years) and sex. Results:  For 15-year-old girls, the implementation of smoke-free legislation in the United Kingdom was associated with a 4.3% reduction in the prevalence of regular smoking ( P = .029). In addition, regular smoking fell by an additional 1.5% per annum post-legislation in this group ( P = .005). Among 13-year-old girls, there was a reduction of 2.8% in regular smoking ( P = .051), with no evidence of a change in trend post-legislation. Smaller and nonsignificant reductions in regular smoking were observed for 15- and 13-year-old boys ( P = .175 and P = .113, respectively).  Conclusions: Smoke-free legislation may help reduce smoking uptake amongst teenagers, with stronger evidence for an association seen in females. Further research that analyses longitudinal data across more countries is required. Implications: Previous research has established that smoke-free legislation has led to many improvements in population health, including reductions in heart attack, stroke, and asthma. However, the impacts of smoke-free legislation on the rates of smoking amongst children have been less investigated. Analysis of repeated cross-sectional surveys across the four countries of the United Kingdom shows smoke-free legislation may be associated with a reduction in regular smoking among school-aged children. If this association is causal, comprehensive smoke-free legislation could help prevent future generations from taking up smoking.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Smoking and Its Determinants in Chinese Internal Migrants: Nationally Representative Cross-Sectional Data Analyses,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Migrants often face multiple risk factors for smoking initiation. Former studies that have explored the smoking habits of Chinese migrants have provided inconsistent findings and lacked nationally representative samples. Methods: Using data from the 2012 Migrant Dynamics Monitoring Survey in China published by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, this study explored current smoking rates and its determinants among migrants in China. Results: The smoking rates of men (46.9%, 46.3%–47.3%) and women (1.8%, 1.7%–1.9%) differed significantly. Although the overall smoking rates in migrants was slightly lower than in the general population, the rates in certain subgroups were much higher. Among men, the three leading associated factors were the following: higher smoking rates among the divorced or widowed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34–1.74); lower smoking rates among those with an educational level of senior high school or above (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.71–0.76), and higher smoking rates in the migrant-receiving area (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.18–1.42). Among women, smoking rates were also higher in the migrant-receiving area (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.34–2.34), when monthly income was more than 3000 Renminbi (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.43–1.90), and among those with an educational level of senior high school or above (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56–0.75). The social integration of migrants, the duration of stay, and working hours had weaker associations with smoking risk. Conclusions: The sociodemographic features, work pressure, and migration-related features were sex-dependent determinants of smoking rates. These factors need to be considered when planning tobacco control interventions among migrants. Implications: Our study was the first to analyze a nationally representative Chinese migrant sample with respect to smoking, its differential rates across various subgroups, and its determinants. Our results provided overall levels of migrant smoking rates. The findings also demonstrated the influences of sex, other sociodemographic variables, migration-related factors, work pressure, and social integration on the smoking habits of migrants. These results provide a database of information for developing and improving tobacco control interventions in migrants.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"Nicotine Dependence and Urinary Nicotine, Cotinine and Hydroxycotinine Levels in Daily Smokers",article,['sex'],"Introduction: Nicotine dependence and smoking frequency are critical factors for smoking cessation. The aims of this study are (1) to determine if nicotine dependence Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores are associated with urinary levels of nicotine metabolites, (2) to assess the relationship of hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio with FTND score and cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), and (3) to identify significant predictors of cigarettes per day among biomarker concentrations and individual FTND items. Methods: Urine samples and questionnaire data of 239 daily smokers were obtained. Nicotine, cotinine and hydroxycotinine urinary levels were determined by UPLC MS/MS. Results: We found significant correlations between the different urinary biomarker concentrations, and the FTND score. The time before the first cigarette after waking (TTFC) was significantly associated with the nicotine, cotinine and hydroxycotinine concentrations. No association was found between the ratio of hydroxycotinine to cotinine and either the FTND or the CPD. A model including four FTND questions, sex, age, and the cotinine concentration, accounted for 45% of the variance of CPD. Conclusions: There are significant relationships between urinary levels of nicotine, cotinine, and hydroxycotinine and the FTND score. Especially the FTND question about TTFC is relevant for explaining the biomarker concentrations. CPD (below 15) was significantly explained by four FTND dependence items and urinary cotinine levels in a regression model. Implications: We investigated associations between urinary levels of nicotine, cotinine, and hydroxycotinine in daily smokers and the FTND scores for nicotine dependence. We did not find association between the hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio and CPD. We developed a model that explains the cigarettes smoked daily (CPD) in a group of light smokers by combining FTND items, urinary cotinine levels, sex, and age. Our results might be of importance for clinical use or future studies on larger smoking populations.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Genome-Wide Association of the Laboratory-Based Nicotine Metabolite Ratio in Three Ancestries,article,"['sex', 'trans']","Introduction:  Metabolic enzyme variation and other patient and environmental characteristics influence smoking behaviors, treatment success, and risk of related disease. Population-specific variation in metabolic genes contributes to challenges in developing and optimizing pharmacogenetic interventions. We applied a custom genome-wide genotyping array for addiction research (Smokescreen), to three laboratory-based studies of nicotine metabolism with oral or venous administration of labeled nicotine and cotinine, to model nicotine metabolism in multiple populations. The trans -3′-hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio, the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), was the nicotine metabolism measure analyzed.  Methods: Three hundred twelve individuals of self-identified European, African, and Asian American ancestry were genotyped and included in ancestry-specific genome-wide association scans (GWAS) and a meta-GWAS analysis of the NMR. We modeled natural-log transformed NMR with covariates: principal components of genetic ancestry, age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status. Results:  African and Asian American NMRs were statistically significantly ( P values ≤ 5E-5) lower than European American NMRs. Meta-GWAS analysis identified 36 genome-wide significant variants over a 43 kilobase pair region at CYP2A6 with minimum P = 2.46E-18 at rs12459249, proximal to CYP2A6 . Additional minima were located in intron 4 (rs56113850, P = 6.61E-18) and in the CYP2A6 - CYP2A7 intergenic region (rs34226463, P = 1.45E-12). Most (34/36) genome-wide significant variants suggested reduced CYP2A6 activity; functional mechanisms were identified and tested in knowledge-bases. Conditional analysis resulted in intergenic variants of possible interest ( P values < 5E-5).  Conclusions:  This meta-GWAS of the NMR identifies CYP2A6 variants, replicates the top-ranked single nucleotide polymorphism from a recent Finnish meta-GWAS of the NMR, identifies functional mechanisms, and provides pan-continental population biomarkers for nicotine metabolism.  Implications:  This multiple ancestry meta-GWAS of the laboratory study-based NMR provides novel evidence and replication for genome-wide association of CYP2A6 single nucleotide and insertion–deletion polymorphisms. We identify three regions of genome-wide significance: proximal, intronic, and distal to CYP2A6 . We replicate the top-ranking single nucleotide polymorphism from a recent GWAS of the NMR in Finnish smokers, identify a functional mechanism for this intronic variant from in silico analyses of RNA-seq data that is consistent with CYP2A6 expression measured in postmortem lung and liver, and provide additional support for the intergenic region between CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 .

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,CHRNA4 and ANKK1 Polymorphisms Influence Smoking-Induced Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Upregulation,article,['sex'],"Introduction:  Tobacco smoking leads to increased numbers of β 2 *-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β 2 *-nAChRs) throughout the brain, which return to nonsmoker levels over extended abstinence. The goal of the current study was to determine whether the degree of tobacco smoking-induced changes in β 2 *-nAChR availability is genetically influenced.  Methods:  In this study, 113 European Americans participated in one or two [ 123 I]5-IA-85380 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scans. Smokers ( n = 58) participated in one scan at 7–9 days of abstinence and those who remained abstinent ( n = 27) were imaged again at 6–8 weeks of abstinence. Age- and sex-matched nonsmokers ( n = 55) participated in one scan. Blood samples were collected for DNA analysis and genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA4 and ANKK1 gene loci. β 2 *-nAChR availability was measured in the thalamus, striatum, cortical regions, and cerebellum.  Results:  The CHRNA4 SNP rs2236196 and ANKK1 SNP rs4938015 were associated with significantly higher cerebellar and cortical β 2 *-nAChR availability in smokers versus nonsmokers for specific genotypes. There were no significant differences by carrier status in the change in β 2 *-nAChR availability in smokers from 7–9 days to 6–8 weeks of abstinence.  Conclusion:  This study provides evidence for genetic regulation of tobacco smoking-induced changes in β 2 *-nAChR availability and suggests that β 2 *-nAChR availability could be an endophenotype mediating influences of CHRNA4 variants on nicotine dependence. These results highlight individual differences in the neurochemistry of nicotine dependence and may suggest the need for individualized programs for smoking cessation.  Implications:  This study demonstrates genetic regulation of smoking-induced changes in β 2 *-nAChRs throughout the brain and highlights the need for personalized programs for smoking cessation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Adolescent Rats Self-Administer Less Nicotine Than Adults at Low Doses,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Although nearly 90% of current smokers initiated tobacco use during adolescence, little is known about reinforcement by nicotine in adolescents. Researchers are currently investigating whether a potential public health policy setting a tobacco product standard with very low nicotine levels would improve public health, and it is essential to understand whether data generated in adults translates to adolescents, particularly as it relates to the threshold dose of nicotine required to support smoking. The present study compared self-administration of low doses of nicotine between adolescent and adult rats. Methods: Adolescent (postnatal day [P] 30) and adult (P90) male and female rats were allowed to nosepoke to receive intravenous infusions of nicotine (3–100 μg/kg/infusion) during 16 daily 1-hour sessions. Results: At 10 μg/kg/infusion nicotine, adolescent rats earned significantly fewer infusions than adults. When responding for 30 μg/kg/infusion nicotine, rats of both ages earned a similar number of infusions; however, there were subtle differences in the distribution of infusions across the 1-hour session. No sex differences were apparent in either age group at any dose. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that adolescent rats are less sensitive than adults to the primary reinforcing effects of nicotine. However, at nicotine doses that support self-administration in both age groups, adolescent and adult rats do not differ in acquisition or number of infusions earned. These results suggest that reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes to a level that does not support smoking in adults may be sufficient to reduce the acquisition of smoking in adolescents. Implications: The results of the present studies demonstrate that adolescent rats are less sensitive than adults to the primary reinforcing effects of nicotine. These results suggest that reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes to a level that does not support smoking in adults will be sufficient to reduce the acquisition of smoking in adolescents.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Cigarette Smoking Condensate Disrupts Endoplasmic Reticulum–Golgi Network Homeostasis Through GOLPH3 Expression in Normal Lung Epithelial Cells,article,['trans'],"Introduction: Cigarette smoke (CS) is associated with a broad range of diseases including lung cancer. Many researchers have suggested that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) may be more toxic compared to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) because CSC contains the lipid-soluble faction of smoke while CSE contains the hydrophilic or gas phase. The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of CSC on the disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi homeostasis in normal lung epithelial cells. Methods: CS was generated according to the ISO 3308 method. To ascertain the mechanistic effects of CSC on lung toxicity, normal lung epithelial cells of the cell line 16HBE14o- were treated with CSC (0.1mg/mL) for 48 hours. The toxic effects of CSC on ER–Golgi homeostasis and GOLPH3 expression were observed through diverse molecular tools including transmission electron microscope analysis. Results: Our results demonstrated that CSC treatment increased reactive oxygen species generation in lung cells and led to the alteration of ER–Golgi homeostasis in conjunction with increased autophagy. In particular, GOLPH3, known as an oncogene and a marker protein for the trans-Golgi network, was upregulated in CSC-treated cells. GOLPH3 protein overexpression was also confirmed in the lungs of human lung cancer patients as well as NNK-treated mice. Conclusion: Our study revealed that CSC caused lung damage through the disruption of ER–Golgi homeostasis and autophagy induction. The expression level of the trans-Golgi marker protein GOLPH3 could serve as a reliable bio-indicator for CS-related lung cancer. Implications: CS is a harmful factor in the development of many diseases including cancer. In this research, we demonstrated that CSC treatment led to malfunction of the ER–Golgi network, with the disrupted ER and Golgi causing GOLPH3 overexpression and abnormal autophagy accumulation. In addition, although the value of GOLPH3 as a predictor remains to be fully elucidated, our data suggest that GOLPH3 levels may be a novel prognostic biomarker of tobacco related lung disease.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Effect of Different Case Definitions of Current Smoking on the Discovery of Smoking-Related Blood Gene Expression Signatures in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Smoking is the number one modifiable environmental risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical, epidemiological and increasingly “omics” studies assess or adjust for current smoking status using only self-report, which may be inaccurate. Objective measures such as exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) may also be problematic owing to limitations in the measurements and the relatively short half life of the molecule. In this study, we determined the impact of different case definitions of current cigarette smoking on gene expression in peripheral blood of patients with COPD. Methods:  Peripheral blood gene expression from 573 former- and current-smokers with COPD in the ECLIPSE study was used to find genes whose expression was associated with smoking status. Current smoking was defined using self-report, eCO concentrations, or both. Linear regression was used to determine the association of current smoking status with gene expression adjusting for age, sex and propensity score. Pathway enrichment analyses were performed on genes with P < .001.  Result: Using self-report or eCO, only two genes were differentially expressed between current and ex-smokers, with no enrichment in biological processes. When current smoking was defined using both eCO and self-report, four genes were differentially expressed (LRRN3, PID1, FUCA1, GPR15) with enrichment in 40 biological pathways related to metabolic processes, response to hypoxia and hormonal stimulus. Additionally, the combined definition provided better distributions of test statistics for differential gene expression. Conclusion: A combined phenotype of eCO and self report allows for better discovery of genes and pathways related to current smoking. Implications: Studies relying only on self report of smoking status to assess or adjust for the impact of smoking may not fully capture its effect and will lead to residual confounding of results.

United States, 2001–2013",article,['gender'],"Introduction: For years, national US surveys have found a lower prevalence of cigarette smoking among non-Hispanic (NH) black adolescents and young adults than their NH white counterparts while finding either similar or higher prevalence in NH blacks among older adults. We present results from four US surveys, including one supplemented by cotinine data, to determine if a race-gender-age crossover effect exists between NH black and NH white current cigarette smokers. Methods: We present NH black and NH white current cigarette smoking estimates in the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2004–2013), National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2002–2013), National Health Interview Survey (2001–2013), and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001–2012). Results: All surveys consistently found that NH black females aged 12–25 years had a lower smoking prevalence than NH white females of the same age while NH black males aged 26 years or older had a higher smoking prevalence than NH white males of the same age. Results were inconsistent between surveys for current smoking estimates for males 12–25 years and females aged 26 years or older. Conclusion: Our results are inconclusive in consistently detecting the existence of a race-gender-age crossover effect for current cigarette smoking between NH blacks and NH whites. National birth cohort studies are better suited to detect a race-gender-age crossover effect in smoking prevalence between these two racial groups.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Cigarette Smoking Among Inmates by Race/Ethnicity: Impact of Excluding African American Young Adult Men From National Prevalence Estimates,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Cigarette smoking prevalence is more than two times greater among incarcerated adults, a population usually excluded from national health surveys. African American young adult (18–25) men are less likely to smoke cigarettes than their white counterparts. However, they are two and a-half-times more likely to be incarcerated. This study estimated smoking prevalence with noninstitutionalized and incarcerated samples combined to determine if excluding incarcerated adults impacts smoking prevalence for certain populations. Methods:  The Bureau of Justice Statistics last fielded the Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correction Facilities in 2003–2004. We combined data from Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correction Facilities ( n = 17 910) and the 2003 and 2004 National Health Interview Survey ( n = 61 470) to calculate combined cigarette smoking estimates by race/ethnicity, sex, and age.  Results: Inmates represented the greatest proportion of smokers among African American men. Among African American young adult men, inmates represented 15.2% of all smokers in the combined population, compared to 2.0% among white young adult men. Cigarette smoking prevalence was 17.6% in the noninstitutionalized population of young adult African American men and 19.7% in the combined population. Among white young adult men, cigarette smoking prevalence was 29.8% in the noninstitutionalized population, and 30.2% in the combined population. There was little difference in estimates among women. Conclusions: The exclusion of incarcerated African American young adult men may result in a small underestimation of cigarette smoking prevalence in this population. Increasing access to smoking cessation support among inmates may reduce smoking prevalence in disproportionately incarcerated segments of the US population. Implications: The exclusion of incarcerated adults from national survey data should be considered when examining differences in cigarette smoking prevalence estimates between African American and white young adult men. Approximately one in six African American young adult men who smoke were incarcerated. Increasing access to smoking cessation support among inmates may reduce smoking prevalence among disproportionately incarcerated segments of the population.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Association of Cigarette Smoking With Depression and Anxiety: A Systematic Review,article,['gender'],"Background: Many studies report a positive association between smoking and mental illness. However, the literature remains mixed regarding the direction of this association. We therefore conducted a systematic review evaluating the association of smoking and depression and/or anxiety in longitudinal studies. Methods: Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science and were included if they: (1) used human participants, (2) were longitudinal, (3) reported primary data, (4) had smoking as an exposure and depression and/or anxiety as an outcome, or (5) had depression and/or anxiety as the exposure and smoking as an outcome. Results: Outcomes from 148 studies were categorized into: smoking onset, smoking status, smoking heaviness, tobacco dependence, and smoking trajectory. The results for each category varied substantially, with evidence for positive associations in both directions (smoking to later mental health and mental health to later smoking) as well as null findings. Overall, nearly half the studies reported that baseline depression/anxiety was associated with some type of later smoking behavior, while over a third found evidence that a smoking exposure was associated with later depression/anxiety. However, there were few studies directly supporting a bidirectional model of smoking and anxiety, and very few studies reporting null results. Conclusions: The literature on the prospective association between smoking and depression and anxiety is inconsistent in terms of the direction of association most strongly supported. This suggests the need for future studies that employ different methodologies, such as Mendelian randomization (MR), which will allow us to draw stronger causal inferences. Implications: We systematically reviewed longitudinal studies on the association of different aspects of smoking behavior with depression and anxiety. The results varied considerably, with evidence for smoking both associated with subsequent depression and anxiety, and vice versa. Few studies supported a bidirectional relationship, or reported null results, and no clear patterns by gender, ethnicity, clinical status, length to follow-up, or diagnostic test. Suggesting that despite advantages of longitudinal studies, they cannot alone provide strong evidence of causality. Therefore, future studies investigating this association should employ different methods allowing for stronger causal inferences to be made, such as MR.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Low Blood Lead Levels in Association With Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Its Symptom Domain in Children: A Community-Based Case–Control Study,article,['gender'],"Aim: Secondhand smoke (SHS) is a major indoor pollutant. We examined the possible association between exposure to both SHS and low levels of lead and attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its symptom domain in children. Methods: This case–control study was based on the results of a community survey using the ADHD rating scale conducted in 49 elementary schools. Both cases and control subjects were confirmed by a child psychiatrist. Each case was matched with one control subject according to gender, school, and grade in school. Using a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, we analyzed 214 case–control pairs of children who ranged in age from 6 to 10 years. Urine and blood levels of cotinine and of lead were determined, and information pertaining to SHS exposure was obtained by means of a questionnaire. Results: Exposure to low levels of lead (geometric mean = 1.65 µg/dL) was related to ADHD, particularly inattention (odds ratio [OR] = 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–2.59), whereas SHS exposure was associated mainly with hyperactivity/impulsivity (OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 1.55–9.56). In the pathway from blood lead to hyperactivity/impulsivity, children’s SHS exposure mediated and indirectly accounted for about 73% of this relationship. The combined exposure to lead and SHS synergistically increased the risk of ADHD, evident as both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Conclusion: SHS, which is associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity in particular, combined with exposure to low blood levels of lead synergistically increased the risk of ADHD. Therefore, the exposure of children to both SHS and lead needs to be reduced. Implications: Although exposure to low levels of lead has been shown to be associated with ADHD, there is little evidence of symptom domain specificity. In our study, low blood lead levels were related to inattention. In addition, prenatal or postnatal exposure to SHS increased the risk of ADHD, particularly hyperactivity/impulsivity. Combined exposure to lead and SHS synergistically increased the risk for both these ADHD symptom domains. To protect children from environmental risk factors related to ADHD, it is necessary to further reduce children’s exposure to SHS and lead, even in those with low blood lead levels.

A mixed GLM model examined main and interaction effects of smoking (daily, intermittent, nonsmoking), year, and gender in predicting complaints. Time periods were segmented to compare trends across smoking groups in specific periods. Results: Prevalence of daily smoking declined from 15.5% (1993/1994) to 6.0% (2009/2010). All health complaint scores were significantly higher for smokers and for girls (vs. boys). Smoking status by year interactions were significant for all complaint variables during the period of sharpest decline of daily smoking prevalence (2001/2002–2005/2006), with daily smokers experiencing increases in health complaints while intermittent and nonsmokers did not. Smoking status by gender interactions were significant for all health complaint variables, indicating that the main effect for gender (females higher) was even stronger among smokers compared with nonsmokers. Using year as unit of analysis, the size of mean differences between daily smokers and intermittent/nonsmokers in total complaints was significantly negatively correlated with daily smoking prevalence (−.963, n = 5, p < .01). Conclusions: As prevalence of daily smoking declined, daily smokers reported higher levels of complaints, suggesting increasing health problems within this group. Girls who smoke daily had particularly elevated levels of complaints. Implications: This study indicates that the relationship between daily smoking and concurrent health symptomatology in adolescents is changing over time, with higher levels of health complaints reported as overall smoking prevalence declines. To our knowledge, this finding has not previously been reported. If youth are smoking to cope with distress, pain, or other health concerns, tobacco control objectives will be increasingly difficult to achieve with adolescents. Levels of health complaints are particularly high among girls who are daily smokers. The findings suggest that restrictive measures and persuasive communications may not be sufficient tobacco prevention strategies for adolescent populations. Young smokers may need counseling and support.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Prenatal Tobacco Exposure Shortens Telomere Length in Children,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Preliminary evidence suggests a possible association between prenatal tobacco exposure and telomere length in children. This study was conducted to investigate whether maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with telomere shortening in their children and whether prenatal and childhood exposure to environmental tobacco had any impact on this association. Methods: This is a population-representative study on the association between prenatal tobacco exposure and telomere length in children. Ninety-eight Hong Kong Chinese children aged under 15 years with prenatal tobacco exposure and 98 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited from a population health study with stratified random sampling. Results: Telomere length in children with prenatal tobacco exposure was significantly shorter than in those with no exposure (mean T/S ratio = 24.9 [SD = 8.58] in exposed vs. 28.97 [14.15] in control groups; P = 0.02). A negative dose–response relationship was observed between the T/S ratio and tobacco exposure duration: the longer the duration of maternal smoking in pregnancy, the shorter the child’s telomere length. The association between the child’s telomere length and prenatal tobacco exposure remained significant after considering the influence of family socioeconomic status and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy and childhood. Conclusions: Prenatal tobacco exposure was associated with telomere shortening in children. As this may impose significant health impacts through fetal genetic programming, more efforts should be made to reduce fetal tobacco exposure by educating pregnant women to not smoke and motivating smokers to quit in early pregnancy. Implications: As reflected by telomere shortening, prenatal tobacco exposure in children can cause premature aging and increased health risks, which we suggest is entirely preventable. Not smoking during pregnancy or quitting smoking is critical to improving the health outcome of our future generations as prenatal tobacco exposure may affect children’s biological programming.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Is the Effect of Anhedonia on Smoking Cessation Greater for Women Versus Men?,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Anhedonia has been recognized as a major risk factor for smoking persistence. Potential gender differences in the effect of anhedonia on smoking cessation have not been studied. Using data from a completed clinical trial of maintenance nicotine patch therapy, we hypothesized that gender would moderate the effect of anhedonia on short-term abstinence, such that anhedonic women would be less likely to achieve abstinence. Methods: Participants (N = 525; 50% female, 48.2% Black/African American, average age: 46 years) received 21mg/day nicotine patch and four brief behavior counseling sessions over 8 weeks. Participants were classified at baseline using the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale as anhedonic (scores > 2) or hedonic (scores ≤ 2). Bioverified 7-day point prevalence abstinence was measured at week 8. Using logistic regression analysis, we tested the interaction of anhedonia by gender predicting abstinence, adjusting for age, race, nicotine dependence, and baseline depressive symptomatology. Results: Seventy participants (13%) were classified as anhedonic. Men were more likely to be anhedonic than women (16.6% vs. 10.2%, p = .03). Contrary to our hypothesis, the interaction of anhedonic status (hedonic vs. anhedonic) by gender was nonsignificant (p = .18). There was a main effect of hedonic capacity, such that anhedonia predicted abstinence, odds ratio = 3.24, 95% confidence interval = 1.39–7.51, p = .006. Conclusion: Both male and female anhedonic smokers were more likely to be abstinent, which contrasts with prior research indicating that anhedonia is a risk factor for difficulty quitting. This unexpected finding may be explained by a possible selective benefit of nicotine patch therapy, which has been observed in some studies to have antidepressant effects. Implications: This is the first study to examine whether the association between pretreatment anhedonia and smoking cessation differs by gender. For both women and men, anhedonia was associated with a greater likelihood of abstinence after 8 weeks of treatment with 21mg/day nicotine patch and behavior counseling. Our findings indicate that the association between anhedonia and smoking cessation is not as clear as has been assumed and may depend in part on the type of treatment delivered.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Attenuated Positive Psychotic Symptoms in Relation to Cigarette Smoking in a Nonclinical Population,article,['sex'],"Introduction: This study explored the association between cigarette smoking and attenuated positive psychotic symptoms in a young adult nonclinical sample. Methods: Undergraduates (N = 930), aged 18–35 years (26.3% male), completed a battery of self-report measures assessing subthreshold psychotic symptoms, cigarette smoking behavior/dependence, and drug use. Results: Individuals endorsing a greater number of attenuated positive psychotic symptoms were more likely to be smokers. Exploratory analyses indicated that the odds of being a smoker were two times greater for those at potential higher risk for psychosis compared with individuals at lower risk. Results were consistent after adjusting for sex and other drug use. Conclusions: In line with findings from psychotic populations, results suggest that attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, particularly those endorsed as distressing in a nonclinical, undergraduate population, are related to cigarette smoking. Implications: Even in nonclinical, undergraduate populations, subthreshold psychotic symptoms are related to cigarette smoking, and cigarette smokers are twice as likely to be considered at potentially higher risk for psychosis compared with noncigarette smokers. In summary, there may be a threshold whereby psychotic symptoms confer increased risk for nicotine consumption, with endorsement of a greater number of distressing subthreshold psychotic symptoms increasing the likelihood of cigarette use.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Can Smoke-Free Policies Reduce Tobacco Use Disparities of Sexual and Gender Minorities in Missouri?,article,"['gender', 'gender minority', 'sexual and gender minority']","Objective The purpose of this study is to explore the associations between smoke-free policies, current and former smoking status, personal smoking restrictions, and intention to quit among sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM individuals in Missouri. Aims and Methods The current analysis derives from the Out, Proud and Healthy project. Chi-squares examined differences between SGM (N = 2210) and non-SGM (N = 586) respondents and former (N = 836) and current (N = 1960) smokers on smoking-related variables. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from logistic regression identified variables associated with former (vs. current) smoking. Results SGM current smokers (25%) were significantly more likely than SGM former smokers (19%) to live in a community without a smoke-free policy. Among SGM current smokers, significantly greater intention to quit was seen in those living in a smoke-free community with a smoke-free policy of two or more years (94%) compared with those living in a community without a smoke-free policy (76%). Conclusions Living in an area with smoke-free policies is related to greater intention to quit among SGM current smokers, greater support for smoke-free policies, and lower smoking prevalence for this community. The SGM community may collectively accrue greater public health benefits from the adoption of smoke-free policies than the non-SGM community. Implications Prior to this study, no data are available regarding current and former smoking status among SGM individuals following the implementation of a local smoke-free policy. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between smoke-free policies, current and former smoking status, and intention to quit among SGM and non-SGM individuals in Missouri. This study finds evidence of lower current smoking prevalence and greater intentions to quit among SGM current smokers who live in communities with smoke-free policies. The SGM community may collectively accrue greater public health benefits from the adoption of smoke-free policies than the non-SGM community.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Declines and Plateaux in Smoking Prevalence Over Three Decades in Fiji,article,['sex'],"Objectives To examine trends from 1980 to 2011 in daily tobacco smoking by sex, ethnicity, age, and urban/rural in Fiji Melanesian (i-Taukei) and Indian adults aged 25–64 years. Methods Unit record data from five population-based surveys (n = 14 528) allowed classification of participants as: (1) never-smoker, ex-smoker, or non-daily smoker; or (2) daily smoker, reporting smoking <20 or ≥20 tobacco products (cigarettes/cigars/pipes) a day. Trends were examined using spline analyses. Results Over 1980–2011 the prevalence of reported daily tobacco smoking decreased significantly in both sexes and ethnicities, with the greatest decline during 1980–2000. Declines were from 81.7% to 27.0% in i-Taukei men; 55.3% to 26.3% in Indian men; 48.1% to 9.5% in i-Taukei women; and 13.8% to 1.3% in Indian women (p < .0001). Declines were consistent across all age groups in men, while there were greater declines among older age groups in women; and greater declines from higher prevalences in rural compared to urban areas in both sexes and ethnicities. Smoking ≥20 tobacco products per day declined significantly in i-Taukei men from 8.0% to 1.9% (p < .0001); there were also declines in Indian men (4.6% to 2.0%) and i-Taukei women (2.6% to 0.6%), but these were not statistically significant; and Indian women remained <0.2% throughout the period. Conclusions Significant declines in daily tobacco smoking have occurred in Fiji in both sexes and ethnicities during the past 30 years, which is consistent with declines in tobacco apparent consumption and household expenditure. However, prevalence remains high in men at around 27% in 2011, with plateau at this level in i-Taukei. Implications This is the first study to show nationally representative population trends in tobacco smoking in a developing country over such a long period (>30 years) based on empirical unit record data (n = 14 528). Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality throughout the Pacific Island region. This is the first study to show evidence of substantial declines over several decades in a cardiovascular disease risk factor in a Pacific Island country, and provides important evidence for further research into the interventions and events which may have facilitated this decline.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Association Between Cigarette Smoking Prevalence and Income Level: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,article,['gender'],"Introduction Previous evidence linked low socioeconomic status with higher smoking prevalence. Our objective was to assess the strength of this association in the world population, updating a previous work. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Subgroup analyses included continents, WHO regions, country mortality levels, gender, age, risk of bias, and study publication date. Independent reviewers selected studies, assessed potential bias and extracted data. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SOCINDEX, AFRICAN INDEX MEDICUS, and LILACS, and other sources from 1989 to 2013 reporting direct measurements of income and current cigarette smoking. Results We retrieved 13,583 articles and included 93 for meta-analysis. Median smoking prevalence was 17.8% (range 3–70%). Lower income was consistently associated with higher smoking prevalence (odds ratio [OR]: 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35–1.56). This association was statistically significant in the subgroup analysis by WHO regions for the Americas (OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.42–1.68), South East Asia (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.10–2.00), Europe (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.29–1.63), and Western Pacific (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.02–1.72), and in studies conducted during 1990s (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.24–1.62) and 2000s (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.30–1.64). Likewise, it was noted in low-mortality countries (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.37–1.60) and for both genders. Prevalence was highest in the lowest income levels compared to the middle (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.49–1.92), followed by the middle level compared to the highest (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.20–1.43). Conclusions Our results show that current cigarette smoking was significantly associated with lower income worldwide and across subgroups, suggesting a dose–response relationship. Implications This unique updated systematic review shows a consistent inverse dose–response relationship between cigarette smoking and income level, present among most geographical areas and country characteristics. Public health measures should take into account this potential inequity and consider special efforts directed to disadvantaged populations.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,"Smoking Cessation Programs for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex People: A Content-Based Systematic Review",article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'intersex', 'lesbian', 'lesbians', 'lgbt', 'transgender']","Introduction Tobacco use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is double the general population. Limited evidence suggests high smoking rates among intersex people. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people are a priority population in Australian health policy, particularly mental health and aging. Despite associations between smoking and noncommunicable diseases relevant to aging and mental health, LGBTI-targeted smoking cessation interventions in Australia have been limited to people living with HIV. Applying existing interventions to marginalized populations without modification and evaluation may fail and exacerbate inequities. Aims To assess outcomes and characterize the populations served, cultural modifications, and behavior change techniques (BCTs) of interventions to reduce LGBTI smoking. Methods We searched MEDLINE, six additional databases, and contacted authors to retrieve published and unpublished program evaluations. Results We retrieved 19 studies (3663 participants). None used control groups. Overall quit rate was 61.0% at the end of interventions and stabilized at 38.6% at 3–6 months. All studies included gay men, 13 included lesbians, 13 “LGBT,” 12 bisexual people, five transgender people, and none included intersex people. Transgender people comprised 3% of participants. Of programs open to women, 27.8% of participants were women. Cultural modifications were used by 17 (89.5%) studies, commonly meeting in LGBT spaces, discussing social justice, and discussing LGBT-specific triggers. Common BCTs included providing normative information, boosting motivation/self-efficacy, relapse prevention, social support, action planning, and discussing consequences. Conclusions Quit rates were high; using control groups would improve evaluation. Existing programs may fail to reach groups other than gay men. Implications This review examines the evidence for LGBTI-targeted smoking cessation interventions. Populations within LGBTI are not proportionally represented in smoking cessation research, and no study addressed intersex smoking. Overall, LGBT-targeted interventions appear to be effective, and simply having an LGBT-specific group may be more effective than groups for the general population. More rigorous research is necessary to draw firm conclusions. Our study space analysis provides suggestions for areas of more targeted research on mechanisms underlying these complex interventions’ success.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Other Risk Factors for Using Higher-Nicotine/Tar-Yield (Regular Full-Flavor) Cigarettes,article,['sex'],"Introduction Use of machine-estimated higher nicotine/tar yield (regular full-flavor) cigarettes is associated with increased risk of nicotine dependence. The present study examined risk factors for using full-flavor versus other cigarette types, including socioeconomic disadvantage and other risk factors for tobacco use or tobacco-related adverse health impacts. Associations between use of full-flavor cigarettes and risk of nicotine dependence were also examined. Methods Data were obtained from nationally representative samples of adult cigarette smokers from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression and classification and regression tree modeling were used to examine associations between use of full-flavor cigarettes and educational attainment, poverty, race/ethnicity, age, sex, mental illness, alcohol abuse/dependence, and illicit drug abuse/dependence. Logistic regression was used to examine risk for nicotine dependence. Results Each of these risk factors except alcohol abuse/dependence independently predicted increased odds of using full-flavor cigarettes (p < .001), with lower educational attainment the strongest predictor, followed by poverty, male sex, younger age, minority race/ethnicity, mental illness, and drug abuse/dependence, respectively. Use of full-flavor cigarettes was associated with increased odds of nicotine dependence within each of these risk factor groupings (p < .01). Cart modeling identified how prevalence of full-flavor cigarette use can vary from a low of 25% to a high of 66% corresponding to differing combinations of these independent risk factors. Conclusions Use of full-flavor cigarettes is overrepresented in socioeconomically disadvantaged and other vulnerable populations, and associated with increased risk of nicotine dependence. Greater regulation of this cigarette type may be warranted. Implications Greater regulation of commercially available Regular Full-Flavor Cigarettes may be warranted. Use of this type of cigarette is overrepresented in socioeconomically disadvantaged and other vulnerable populations and associated with increased risk for nicotine dependence.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Qualitative Study Among Mexican Americans to Understand Factors Influencing the Adoption and Enforcement of Home Smoking Bans,article,['gender'],"Introduction One-third of Mexican-American children, in addition to nonsmoker adults, are exposed to secondhand smoke at home, yet few interventions target Mexican-American households. An effective, brief English language program, tested with United Way 2-1-1 callers in Atlanta, increased home smoking bans (confirmed by air monitors). Two randomized controlled trials in North Carolina and Texas replicated those results. We explored factors determining adoption and enforcement of smoking bans in Mexican-American households to inform program linguistic and cultural adaptation to broaden program reach and relevance. Methods Bilingual interviewers recruited convenience samples of Mexican-American smokers and nonsmokers living with at least one smoker in Houston and San Diego households and asked open-ended questions regarding conditions for implementing home and vehicle smoking bans and conditions for varying acceptance of bans. Investigators independently reviewed English transcripts and completed a descriptive analysis using ATLAS.ti. Results Participants (n = 43) were predominantly female (n = 31), current smokers (n = 26), interviewed in Spanish (n = 26), had annual household incomes less than $30000 (n = 24), and allowed smoking inside the home (n = 24). Themes related to difficulty creating and enforcing bans included courtesy, respect for guests and heads of household who smoke, and gender imbalances in decision making. Participants viewed protecting children’s health as a reason for the ban but not protecting adult nonsmokers’ health. Conclusion A dual-language, culturally adapted intervention targeting multigenerational Mexican-American households should address household differences regarding language and consider influences of cultural values on family dynamics and interactions with guests that may weaken bans. Implications Qualitative interviews suggested cultural and family considerations to address in adapting a brief evidence-based smoke-free homes intervention for Mexican Americans, including traditional gender roles, unique contexts of multigenerational households, and language preferences. Our work confirms previous research among Latinos regarding importance of common cultural constructs, such as respeto (deference), simpatia (courtesy and agreeability), and familismo (family attachment), which inform behaviors that may impede or facilitate adopting and enforcing home smoking bans. Decision-making gender imbalances, high regard for head-of-household and guest smokers, and less sensitivity to the health of nonsmoker adults compared with children may lead to permission to smoke indoors.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Social Gradient in Tobacco Use Does Not Generalize to Low-Income Urban Communities in India: Findings From a Census Survey,article,"['gender', 'sex']","Introduction The existence of a social gradient in tobacco use has been clearly established in a number of countries with people with lower socioeconomic status being more likely to use tobacco. It is not clear how far this gradient is evident within severely deprived communities. This study assessed the association between occupation as a marker of socioeconomic status and use of smoked and smokeless tobacco within “slum” areas of Delhi, India. Methods A census survey of 11 888 households, comprising 30 655 adults from 28 low-income communities (14 government-authorized and 14 unauthorized settlements called “Jhuggi-Jhopri/JJ” clusters) was conducted in 2012. The survey assessed age, sex, household size, occupational group, and current tobacco use. Independent associations with tobacco use were conducted using complex samples regression analysis, stratified by gender. Results A quarter of participants (24.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.5–27.5) used any tobacco. Slightly more people used smoked (14.6%, 95% CI 12.9–16.3) than smokeless (12.6%, 95% CI 10.7–14.8) tobacco, with a small minority being dual users (2.7%, 95% CI 2.1–3.5). Prevalence of any tobacco use was highest in unskilled (45.13%, 95% CI 42.4–47.9) and skilled (46.2%, 95% CI 41.1–51.4) manual occupations and lower in nonmanual (30.3%, 95% CI 26.2–34.7) occupations and those who were unemployed (29.0%, 95% CI 25.3–33.0). This was confirmed in adjusted analysis in men but associations were more complex in women. Conclusions Use of smoked and smokeless tobacco in low-income urban communities in India has a complex association with occupational status with both nonmanual occupation and unemployment being associated with lower prevalence of smoked and smokeless tobacco in men. Implications Tobacco use in high-income countries shows a strong inverse relationship with social grade, income, and deprivation such that use is much more common among those who can least afford it. This study is the first to look at this social gradient in the context of low-income communities in India, finding that both unemployment and nonmanual occupation were associated with lower rates of tobacco use in men. The data present a challenge to existing explanations of the social gradient, requiring further consideration of the conditions under which affordability may work to reduce health inequalities arising from tobacco use.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,"Cigarette Purchasing Patterns, Readiness to Quit, and Quit Attempts Among Homeless Smokers",article,['sex'],"Introduction Cigarette purchasing patterns may be linked with greater readiness to make a quit attempt and more quit attempts among domiciled samples. However, little is known about the cigarette purchasing patterns of homeless smokers or their potential relations to quitting intention and behaviors. This study redressed this gap among a convenience sample of homeless adult smokers from a large shelter in Dallas, Texas. Methods Participants (N = 207; Mage = 43; 71.5% male) smoked ≥100 cigarettes over the lifetime and endorsed current daily smoking. Variables assessed included cigarette dependence (time to first cigarette of the day), monthly income, quantity of cigarettes most recently purchased, average money spent on cigarettes weekly, readiness/motivation to quit smoking, and the number intentional quit attempts lasting ≥24h in the past year. Regression analyses were conducted to characterize associations of cigarette purchasing patterns with readiness to quit and quit attempts controlling for sex, age, cigarette dependence, and income. Results Most participants purchased cigarettes by the pack (61.4%), and more than half the sample spent ≤$20 on cigarettes per week. Results indicated that spending less money per week on cigarettes was associated with greater readiness to quit (P = .016), even when controlling for income, cigarette dependence, and other covariates. Stratified analyses indicated that this association was significant only for homeless smokers reporting no regular monthly income. Conclusions Homeless daily smokers with no reported income who spend little money on cigarettes may make particularly apt targets for cessation interventions due to potential associations with quitting motivation. Implications Adults who are homeless smoke at greater rates and quit at lower rates than domiciled adults, leading to significant smoking-related health disparities among this group. Findings suggest that cigarette purchasing patterns are linked with readiness to quit smoking among smokers who are homeless. Results elucidate one of the myriad factors that contribute to tobacco-related disparities among this group and findings may have implications for cessation interventions in homeless shelters and other contexts where resources are limited.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Concurrent E-Cigarette Use During Tobacco Dependence Treatment in Primary Care Settings: Association With Smoking Cessation at Three and Six Months,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are being used as cessation aids by many smokers despite a lack of empirical evidence regarding their safety and efficacy. We analyzed the association of e-cigarette use and smoking abstinence in a population of smokers accessing standard smoking cessation treatment (nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] plus behavioral counseling) through primary care clinics in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Participants were recruited through 187 primary care clinics across Ontario, Canada and were eligible for up to 26 weeks of brief behavioral counseling and individualized dosing of NRT at no cost. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine the association between concurrent e-cigarette use and smoking abstinence at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Results: Of the 6526 participants who completed a 3-month follow-up, 18.1% reported using an e-cigarette while in treatment. The majority of e-cigarette users (78.2%) reported using an e-cigarette for smoking cessation. At 3-month follow-up, e-cigarette use was negatively associated with abstinence after controlling for confounders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.706, p < .001, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.607–0.820). E-cigarette use was also negatively associated with abstinence at 6-month follow-up (AOR = 0.502, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.393–0.640). Conclusion: E-cigarette use was negatively associated with successful quitting in this large community sample of smokers accessing standard evidence-based smoking cessation treatment through primary care clinics, even after adjusting for covariates such as severity of tobacco dependence, gender, and age. The findings suggest that concurrent use of e-cigarettes with NRT may harm cessation attempts. Implications: This study confirms previous findings from observational studies regarding the negative association between e-cigarette use and smoking cessation, but in a large cohort of smokers enrolled in an evidence-based treatment program. The implications of these findings are that concurrent use of e-cigarettes during a quit attempt utilizing cost-free evidence-based treatment (NRT plus behavioral counseling) does not confer any added benefit and may hamper successful quitting.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Knowledge and Beliefs About E-Cigarettes in Straight-to-Work Young Adults,article,['straight'],"Introduction: Young adults are a growing segment of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users. Young adults who go straight to work (STW) from high school make up a large portion of the young adult population, yet research to date has focused on college-educated young adults. This study explored STW young adult beliefs and knowledge about e-cigarettes. Methods: Semistructured individual interviews were used to elicit in-depth information from STW young adults ages 19–31 from a state in the southwest United States. Thirty interviews were conducted focusing on beliefs about e-cigarettes, current knowledge, and information-seeking practices. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo. Results: Nine themes were identified falling into three categories: (1) beliefs about e-cigarettes, (2) knowledge about e-cigarettes, and (3) personal rules about e-cigarettes. STW young adults held positive beliefs about the health and safety of e-cigarettes for themselves, others, and the environment. They reported their social networks and the Internet as reliable sources of information about e-cigarettes, but they reported parents as the best source for advice. Participants had rules about e-cigarettes that contradicted some of their beliefs such as using e-cigarettes around children indicating that their beliefs were not as strongly held as they initially reported. Conclusions: Industry marketing and contradictory information may contribute to STW young adult knowledge and beliefs about e-cigarettes. Lack of credible public health information may also contribute to this issue. Ensuring that what is known about the benefits and harms of e-cigarettes is conveyed through multichannel communication and continued monitoring of marketing practices of the e-cigarette industry in light of the soon to be implemented regulations should be top priorities for public health. Implications: Beliefs and knowledge of STW young adults have not been explored even though they are heavily targeted by the e-cigarette industry. This group holds strong positive beliefs about the health and safety of e-cigarettes, despite having little credible knowledge about them. This study indicates a need for efforts focused on educating STW young adults on the potential risks and benefits of e-cigarettes and the communication of credible information or at minimum the acknowledgment of the uncertainty regarding the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes. It also indicates a need for continued monitoring and advocacy related to marketing practices of the e-cigarette industry.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Short Form Vaping Consequences Questionnaire: Psychometric Properties of a Measure of Vaping Expectancies for Use With Adult E-cigarette Users,article,['sex'],"Introduction: E-cigarettes are popular in the United States, but psychometrically sound measures of vaping beliefs and behaviors are lacking. Methods: We evaluated the psychometrics of the Short Form Vaping Consequences Questionnaire (S-VCQ), a modified version of the Short Form Smoking Consequences Questionnaire that assesses expectancies for negative consequences, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and appetite/weight control associated with vaping. Adult, past-month e-cigarette users completed an anonymous survey in Fall 2015 (N = 522, 50.4% female; 71.5% white; 34.10 [SD = 9.66] years). Psychometric analyses included confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency, measurement invariance, t tests, correlations, and test-criterion relationships with vaping outcomes. Results: The S-VCQ evidenced a four-factor latent structure (Bentler’s Comparative Fit Index = .95, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = .05, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = .06), and subscales evidenced internal consistency (mean α = 0.89). S-VCQ scores were scalar invariant for sex and smoking status; women reported stronger appetite/weight control than men and dual cigarette/e-cigarette users (n = 309) reported stronger negative vaping consequences and negative reinforcement than nonsmokers. Among dual users, vaping and smoking expectancies also were scalar invariant; dual users reported stronger positive reinforcement associated with vaping than smoking but stronger negative consequences, negative reinforcement, and appetite/weight control associated with smoking than vaping. Correlations indicated that vaping and smoking expectancies were related, yet distinct constructs. Univariate general linear models indicated that vaping frequency and dependence were associated with positive reinforcement (ηp2 = .02/.02), negative reinforcement (ηp2 = .02/.08), and appetite/weight control (ηp2 = .02/.02) from vaping. Conclusions: The S-VCQ evidences solid psychometrics as a measure of adult e-cigarette users’ vaping expectancies. Implications: The current study provides evidence for the reliability and validity of the S-VCQ, the first measure of vaping expectancies that has been validated for use with adult e-cigarette users. Results indicated that the S-VCQ comprises four subscales that evidence internal consistency, scalar measurement invariance for important groups of interest, and test-criterion relationships with vaping outcomes. Researchers are encouraged to consider using this measure for assessing vaping expectancies in adult e-cigarette users.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Sex Differences in Smoking Cessation Pharmacotherapy Comparative Efficacy: A Network Meta-analysis,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Converging clinical and biological evidence suggest sex is an important factor when selecting a pharmacological intervention for smoking cessation. The current investigation used network meta-analyses to estimate sex differences in the comparative efficacy of transdermal nicotine (TN), varenicline, and sustained release (SR) bupropion for smoking cessation. Methods: Systematically searched previously published reviews and databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of bupropion-SR, TN, and varenicline for cigarette smoking cessation in primary care/general community samples were included. Results: Thirty-two studies met all criteria and 28 (88%) were included in the final analyses, representing 14 389 smokers (51% female). Results of the full sample (women and men combined) mirrored those from a Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group network meta-analysis of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, showing VAR>TN=BUP. All medications improved quit rates over placebo for both women and men. Relative to placebo, varenicline efficacy was similar for women and men. Significant sex differences were evident when comparing varenicline versus TN and varenicline versus bupropion. For women, varenicline was more efficacious than TN (RR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.12,1.76) and bupropion (RR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.08,1.77). For men, outcomes for those treated with TN and bupropion were similar to those treated with varenicline. There were no differences in efficacy when comparing bupropion versus TN. Conclusions: The advantage of varenicline over bupropion SR and TN is greater for women than men. Clinicians should strongly consider varenicline as the first option treatment for women. Among men, the advantage of varenicline over TN or bupropion is less clear. Implications: This study provides information for the sex-informed treatment of nicotine addiction among cigarette smokers. Relative to placebo, women and men achieved similar outcomes when treated with varenicline; however the advantages of varenicline over transdermal patch and bupropion were greater for women compared to men.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Worsening Dietary and Physical Activity Behaviors Do Not Readily Explain Why Smokers Gain Weight After Cessation: A Cohort Study in Young Adults,article,['sex'],"Introduction: The relationship between smoking cessation and weight gain is well established but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aimed to determine whether postcessation weight gain was mediated by changing health behaviors. Methods: A total of 281 smokers self-reported their demographic, smoking, and lifestyle characteristics in 2004–2006 (aged 26–36) and 2009–2011 (aged 31–41). Behaviors considered as potential mediators of weight gain were changes in consumption of breakfast, discretionary foods (servings/d), fruit and vegetables (servings/d), alcohol (g/d), takeaway food (times/wk), Diet Guideline Index score, leisure time physical activity (PA, min/wk), total PA (min/wk), time spent sitting (min/d), and TV viewing (h/d). Results: In total, 124 smokers quit smoking during 5 years follow-up. After adjustment for age, sex, baseline body mass index, education, and follow-up length, smoking cessation was associated with average excess weight gain of 2.09kg (95% CI = 0.35–3.83). Compared with continuing smokers, quitters reported a higher Diet Guideline Index score and less consumption of alcohol at baseline and follow-up (all p < .05). In addition, there was a tendency towards healthier dietary and PA behaviors over 5 years among quitters than continuing smokers except for time spent sitting, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Adjustment for changes in these behaviors made little difference to the magnitude of postcessation weight gain (β: 2.32kg, 95% CI = 0.54–4.10). Conclusions: The weight gain associated with smoking cessation was not explained by worsening dietary and PA behaviors. Future research is needed to elucidate the complex mechanisms and particularly ways it may be prevented. Implications: Fear of weight gain often discourages smokers from trying to quit but guidance on ways to most effectively avoid weight gain is lacking. It is important to identify what causes postcessation weight gain and the ways it may be prevented. The current study explored the effects of several changing dietary and PA behaviors on the relationship between smoking cessation and weight gain in 281 young Australian smokers. We found that quitters tended to adopt healthier dietary and PA behaviors than continuing smokers, so these behaviors did not readily explain the postcessation weight gain. Further investigations of other potential mechanisms are needed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Genetic Epidemiological Mega Analysis of Smoking Initiation in Adolescents,article,"['same-sex', 'sex']","Introduction: Previous studies in adolescents were not adequately powered to accurately disentangle genetic and environmental influences on smoking initiation (SI) across adolescence. Methods: Mega-analysis of pooled genetically informative data on SI was performed, with structural equation modeling, to test equality of prevalence and correlations across cultural backgrounds, and to estimate the significance and effect size of genetic and environmental effects according to the classical twin study, in adolescent male and female twins from same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs (N = 19 313 pairs) between ages 10 and 19, with 76 358 longitudinal assessments between 1983 and 2007, from 11 population-based twin samples from the United States, Europe, and Australia. Results: Although prevalences differed between samples, twin correlations did not, suggesting similar etiology of SI across developed countries. The estimate of additive genetic contributions to liability of SI increased from approximately 15% to 45% from ages 13 to 19. Correspondingly, shared environmental factors accounted for a substantial proportion of variance in liability to SI at age 13 (70%) and gradually less by age 19 (40%). Conclusions: Both additive genetic and shared environmental factors significantly contribute to variance in SI throughout adolescence. The present study, the largest genetic epidemiological study on SI to date, found consistent results across 11 studies for the etiology of SI. Environmental factors, especially those shared by siblings in a family, primarily influence SI variance in early adolescence, while an increasing role of genetic factors is seen at later ages, which has important implications for prevention strategies. Implications: This is the first study to find evidence of genetic factors in liability to SI at ages as young as 12. It also shows the strongest evidence to date for decay of effects of the shared environment from early adolescence to young adulthood. We found remarkable consistency of twin correlations across studies reflecting similar etiology of liability to initiate smoking across different cultures and time periods. Thus familial factors strongly contribute to individual differences in who starts to smoke with a gradual increase in the impact of genetic factors and a corresponding decrease in that of the shared environment.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Classification Tree Analysis as a Method for Uncovering Relations Between CHRNA5A3B4 and CHRNB3A6 in Predicting Smoking Progression in Adolescent Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Prior research suggests the CHRNA5A3B4 and CHRNB3A6 gene clusters have independent effects on smoking progression in young smokers. Here classification tree analysis uncovers conditional relations between these genes. Methods: Conditional classification tree and random forest analyses were employed to predict daily smoking at 6-year follow-up in a longitudinal sample of young smokers (N = 480) who had smoked at least one puff at baseline and were of European ancestry. Potential predictors included gender, lifetime smoking, Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS), and five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging CHRNB3A6 and CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotypes A, B, and C. Conditional random forest analysis was used to calculate variable importance. Results: The classification tree identified NDSS, the CHRNB3A6 SNP rs2304297, and the CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C SNP rs6495308 as predictive of year 6 daily smoking with the baseline NDSS identified as the strongest predictor. The CHRNB3A6 protective effect was contingent on a lower level of baseline NDSS, whereas the CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C protective effect was seen at a higher level of baseline NDSS. A CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C protective effect also was observed in participants with low baseline NDSS who had no CHRNB3A6 rs2304297 minor allele. Conclusions: The protective effects of CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C and CHRNB3A6 on smoking progression are conditional on different levels of baseline cigarette use. Also, duplicate dominant epistasis between SNPs indicated the minor allele of either SNP afforded comparable protective effects in the absence of a minor allele at the other locus. Possible mechanisms underlying these conditional relations are discussed. Implications: The substantive contributions of this paper are the demonstration of a difference in the protective effects of CHRNB3A6 and CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C in young smokers attributable to level of cigarette use, as well as observation of duplicate dominant epistasis between the two markers. The methodological contribution is demonstrating that classification tree and random forest statistical methods can uncover conditional relations among genetic effects not detected with more common regression methods.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure Associations With DNA Methylation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Repressor,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Cigarette smoking is inversely associated with DNA methylation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR; cg05575921). However, the association between secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure and AHRR methylation is unknown. Methods: DNA methylation of AHRR cg05575921 in CD14+ monocyte samples, from 495 never-smokers and 411 former smokers (having quit smoking ≥15 years) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), was cross-sectionally compared with concomitantly ascertained self-reported SHS exposure, urine cotinine concentrations, and estimates of air pollutants at participants’ homes. Linear regression was used to test for associations, and covariates included age, sex, race, education, study site, and previous smoking exposure (smoking status, time since quitting, and pack-years). Results: Recent indoor SHS exposure (hours per week) was inversely associated with cg05575921 methylation (β ± SE = −0.009 ± 0.003, p = .007). The inverse effect direction was consistent (but did not reach significance) in the majority of stratified analyses (by smoking status, sex, and race). Categorical analysis revealed high levels of recent SHS exposure (≥10 hours per week) inversely associated with cg05575921 methylation (β ± SE = −0.28 ± 0.09, p = .003), which remained significant (p < .05) in the majority of stratified analyses. cg05575921 methylation did not significantly (p < .05) associate with low to moderate levels of recent SHS exposure (1–9 hours per week), urine cotinine concentrations, years spent living with people smoking, years spent indoors (not at home) with people smoking, or estimated levels of air pollutants. Conclusions: High levels of recent indoor SHS exposure may be inversely associated with DNA methylation of AHRR in human monocytes. Implications: DNA methylation is a biochemical alteration that can occur in response to cigarette smoking; however, little is known about the effect of SHS on human DNA methylation. In the present study, we evaluated the association between SHS exposure and DNA methylation in human monocytes, at a site (AHRR cg05575921) known to have methylation inversely associated with current and former cigarette smoking compared to never smoking. Results from this study suggest high levels of recent SHS exposure inversely associate with DNA methylation of AHRR cg05575921 in monocytes from nonsmokers, albeit with weaker effects than active cigarette smoking.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Resting-State Functional Connectivity of the Basal Nucleus of Meynert in Cigarette Smokers: Dependence Level and Gender Differences,article,"['gender', 'sex']","Introduction: Numerous studies have characterized impaired cerebral functioning in nicotine-addicted individuals. Whereas nicotine interacts with multiple neurotransmitters in cortical and subcortical circuits, it directly targets the cholinergic system, sourced primarily from the basal nucleus of Meynert (BNM). However, no studies have examined how this cholinergic system is influenced by cigarette smoking. Here, we addressed this gap of research. Methods: Using a dataset from the Functional Connectome Projects, we investigated this issue by contrasting seed-based BNM connectivity of 40 current smokers and 170 age- and gender-matched nonsmokers. We followed our data analytic routines in recent work and examined differences between smokers and nonsmokers in men and women combined as well as separately. Results: Compared to nonsmokers, female but not male smokers demonstrated greater positive BNM connectivity to the supplementary motor area, bilateral anterior insula, and right superior temporal/supramarginal gyri as well as greater negative connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Further, BNM connectivity to the supplementary motor area is negatively correlated to the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence score in male but not female smokers. Conclusions: Along with a previous report of upregulated nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in male but not female smokers, these new findings highlight functional changes of the cholinergic systems in cigarette smokers. The results suggest sex-specific differences in cholinergic dysregulation and a need for multiple imaging modalities to capture the neural markers of nicotine addiction. Implications: Nicotine influences cognition via cholinergic projections of the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex. This study examined changes in resting-state whole-brain functional connectivity of the BNM in cigarette smokers. The new findings elucidate for the first time sex differences in BNM–cerebral connectivity in cigarette smoking.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Sex Differences and Drug Dose Influence the Role of the α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor in the Mouse Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis Model,article,['sex'],"Introduction: α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in vagus nerve-based cholinergic anti-inflammatory effects. This study was designed to assess the role of α7 nAChRs in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in male and female mouse. We first compared disease activity and pathogenesis of colitis in α7 knockout and wild-type mice. We then evaluated the effect of several α7 direct and indirect agonists on the severity of disease in the DSS-induced colitis. Methods: Male and female adult mice were administered 2.5% DSS solution freely in the drinking water for 7 consecutive days and the colitis severity (disease activity index) was evaluated as well as colon length, colon histology, and levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha colonic levels. Results: Male, but not female, α7 knockout mice displayed a significantly increased colitis severity and higher tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels as compared with their littermate wild-type mice. Moreover, pretreatment with selective α7 ligands PHA-543613, choline, and PNU-120596 decreased colitis severity in male but not female mice. The anti-colitis effects of these α7 compounds dissipated when administered at higher doses. Conclusions: Our results suggest the presence of a α7-dependent anti-colitis endogenous tone in male mice. Finally, our results show for the first time that female mice are less sensitive to the anti-colitis activity of α7 agonists. Ovarian hormones may play a key role in the sex difference effect of α7 nAChRs modulation of colitis in the mouse. Implications: Our collective results suggest that targeting α7 nAChRs could represent a viable therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammation diseases such as ulcerative colitis with the consideration of sex differences.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Development of a Self-Report Measure of Reward Sensitivity:A Test in Current and Former Smokers,article,['sex'],"Introduction: Tobacco use or abstinence may increase or decrease reward sensitivity. Most existing measures of reward sensitivity were developed decades ago, and few have undergone extensive psychometric testing. Methods: We developed a 58-item survey of the anticipated enjoyment from, wanting for, and frequency of common rewards (the Rewarding Events Inventory—REI). The current analysis focuses on ratings of anticipated enjoyment. The first validation study recruited current and former smokers from Internet sites. The second study recruited smokers who wished to quit and monetarily reinforced them to stay abstinent in a laboratory study and a comparison group of former smokers. In both studies, participants completed the inventory on two occasions, 3–7 days apart. They also completed four anhedonia scales and a behavioral test of reduced reward sensitivity. Results: Half of the enjoyment ratings loaded on four factors: socializing, active hobbies, passive hobbies, and sex/drug use. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were all ≥0.73 for overall mean and factor scores. Test-retest correlations were all ≥0.83. Correlations of the overall and factor scores with frequency of rewards and anhedonia scales were 0.19–0.53, except for the sex/drugs factor. The scores did not correlate with behavioral tests of reward and did not differ between current and former smokers. Lower overall mean enjoyment score predicted a shorter time to relapse. Discussion: Internal reliability and test-retest reliability of the enjoyment outcomes of the REI are excellent, and construct and predictive validity are modest but promising. The REI is comprehensive and up-to-date, yet is short enough to use on repeated occasions. Replication tests, especially predictive validity tests, are needed. Implications: Both use of and abstinence from nicotine appear to increase or decrease how rewarding nondrug rewards are; however, self-report scales to test this have limitations. Our inventory of enjoyment from 58 rewards appears to be reliable and valid as well as comprehensive and up-to-date, yet is short enough to use on repeated occasions. Replication tests, especially of the predictive validity of our scale, are needed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,"Anhedonia and Abstinence as Predictors of the Subjective Pleasantness of Positive, Negative, and Smoking-Related Pictures",article,['sex'],"Introduction: Anhedonia—diminished interest or pleasure in response to rewards—is a dimension implicated in several psychiatric disorders linked to smoking. This laboratory study sought to identify motivational mechanisms linking anhedonia and tobacco addiction by testing the hypothesis that anhedonia, abstinence, and their interaction would predict excesses and deficits in the perceived pleasantness of smoking-related and positive pictures, respectively. We assessed the pleasantness of negative pictures as a secondary outcome. Methods: After a baseline session involving self-report measures of anhedonia and other factors, 125 regular smokers attended two counterbalanced experimental sessions (overnight abstinent and non-abstinent) at which they rated the pleasantness of positive, smoking-related, negative, and neutral (control) pictures presented via computer. The difference in pleasantness ratings of positive, smoking-related, and negative pictures relative to neutral pictures served as the index of participants’ appraisal of the motivational salience of nondrug reward, drug reward, and aversive signals, respectively. Results: With and without adjusting for sex and depressive symptoms, greater anhedonia significantly or marginally predicted greater pleasantness of smoking (vs. neutral), lower pleasantness of positive (vs. neutral), less unpleasantness of negative (vs. neutral) pictures (|βs| = 0.18 to 0.35, ps = .007 to .07). Anhedonia by abstinence interaction effects on pleasantness ratings of each stimulus category (vs. neutral) were not significant (|βs| ≤ 0.02, ps ≥ .36). Conclusions: Anhedonia and abstinence additively increase the salience of smoking-related cues in anhedonic smokers. Smoking cessation efforts that attenuate sensitization to smoking stimuli may benefit anhedonic smokers early in quit attempts. Implications: Taken together, these findings provide tentative evidence that anhedonia is associated with a relative imbalance in the motivational salience of drug relative to nondrug rewards and may be associated with a generalized hypo-reactivity to both positive and negative stimuli. Though some prior smoking research has evidenced this relative imbalance in anhedonia with self-report or a smoking-choice task, we additionally show that this pattern may extend to hyper-affective reactivity to smoking-related stimuli being coincident with hypo-affective reactivity to nondrug-related positive stimuli (ie, may extend to greater pleasantness ratings of smoking pictures being accompanied by lower pleasantness ratings of positive pictures).

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy Is Associated With Offspring’s Musculoskeletal Pain in Adolescence: Structural Equation Modeling,article,['gender'],"Introduction: Smoking and behavioral problems are related to musculoskeletal (MS) pain in adolescence. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is associated with offspring’s behavioral problems but its relation to MS pain in adolescence is unknown. Our purpose was to investigate whether there is an association between MSDP, the number of pain sites in adolescence, and the factors that potentially mediate this relationship. Methods: We evaluated the association of MSDP with offspring’s MS pain at 16 years among participants of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n = 6436, 3360 girls, 68% of all births) using Chi-square test and independent samples t test. We used structural equation modeling to assess the mediating factors stratified by gender. Results: MSDP was frequent (22%) associating with paternal smoking (p < .001), externalization problems at 8 years (p = .009 boys, p = .002 girls), offspring’s smoking at 16 years (p < .001), externalizing problems at 16 years (p < .001), family’s social class (p < .001) and intactness of the family status (p < .001). The mean number of offspring’s MS pain sites was higher among adolescents whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy than among those whose mothers were nonsmokers (p = .002 boys, p = .012 girls). The association between MSDP and MS pain at 16 years was mediated by externalizing problems at 8 years (p < .001) and 16 years (p < 0.001). Conclusions: MSDP increased the risk of offspring’s MS pain in adolescence, and the association was mediated by offspring’s externalizing problems during childhood and early adolescence. Implications: This study indicates that MSDP increases the risk of MS pain in adolescence and the effect is mediated by externalizing problems. Our results add to the evidence on harmfulness of MSDP for offspring, and can be used as additional information in interventions aiming to influence MSDP.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Time From Smoking Cessation and Inflammatory Markers: New Evidence From a Cross-Sectional Analysis of ELSA-Brasil,article,['sex'],"Introduction: The time for inflammatory markers of former smokers to revert to never smoker levels is still controversial, ranging from 5 to 20 years. We aimed to determine the time from smoking cessation for white blood cell (WBC) count and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels to return to those of never-smokers, after adjusting for confounding factors and for secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline participants of ELSA-Brasil. We used linear regression analysis and generalized linear models with gamma distribution and logarithmic link function to estimate the association of WBC count and CRP levels with time from smoking cessation. The following confounding factors were considered: sex, age, education, SHS, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, BMI, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: After all adjustments, time from smoking cessation <10 years remained associated with higher WBC count (eg, time from smoking cessation ≥ 5 and <10 years: β: 167.92; 95%CI: 23.52 312.31), while only time from smoking cessation <1 year remained associated with higher arithmetic mean of CRP (AMR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.03‒1.54). Conclusions: Levels of inflammatory markers were similar to those of never-smokers 1 year after smoking cessation for CRP and 10 years after for WBC. Implications: The results may add to the arsenal health professionals have to encourage their patients to quit smoking, as some harms from smoking appear to revert to never-smokers’ level sooner than previously reported. Longitudinal studies should confirm our findings.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Searching for the Smoker’s Paradox in Acute Stroke Patients Treated With Intravenous Thrombolysis,article,['gender'],"Background: Inconsistent evidence supports better outcome in smokers after stroke. Our study examines this association in a large sample of ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Method: Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) database, composed of individual patient data of multiple clinical trials, was queried. The primary outcome was functional independence at 3 months noted by modified Rankin Scale (mRS; a 7-point scale ranging from 0 [no deficit] to 6 [death]) score≤ 2. The secondary outcomes were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; stroke severity measure, ranging from 0 [no deficit] to 42 [most severe]) score at 24 hours and the occurrence of symptomatic intractracranial hemorrhage. Results: A total of 5383 patients were included: 1501 current smokers and 3882 nonsmokers. Smokers were younger (60 ± 13 vs. 71 ± 12 years, p < .0001) and had lower median NIHSS score at baseline (12 [8–17] vs. 13 [9–18], p < .0001). The rate of favorable functional outcome (mRS ≤ 2) at 3 months was significantly higher among current smokers (49.7% vs. 39.5%, p < .0001) and with crude ORs of 1.52, 95% CI 1.33–1.72. The association became non-significant after adjusting for age (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97–1.27). Subgroup analysis by age/gender strata showed that current smoking was associated with favorable outcome only in women ≥ 65 years. Current smoking was also associated with lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39–0.79). Conclusion: Smokers experience their first ever stroke 11 years younger than nonsmokers. This age difference explains the association between current smoking and favorable functional outcome. Implications: Smoking is associated with occurrence of first ever stroke at a younger age, therefore, focus should be on smoking prevention and treatment. The decision to treat ischemic stroke patients with intravenous thrombolysis should not be influenced by the patients’ smoking status.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,LGBTQ Youth and Young Adult Perspectives on a Culturally Tailored Group Smoking Cessation Program,article,"['lgbtq', 'non-lgbtq']","Introduction The prevalence of smoking among LGBTQ youth and young adults (YYAs) is much higher than that of non-LGBTQ young people. The current study explored LGBTQ YYA perceptions of a culturally tailored group smoking cessation counselling program, along with how the intervention could be improved. Methods We conducted focus groups (n = 24) with 204 LGBTQ YYAs in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. Open-ended questions focused on their feelings, likes and dislikes, concerns and additional ideas for a culturally tailored group cessation counselling intervention. Focus group transcripts were coded thematically and analyzed. Results Overall, YYAs were ambivalent towards the concept of a culturally tailored, group cessation counselling program. Although several participants were attracted to the LGBTQ friendly and social benefits of such a program (eg, good support system), many also had concerns. Particularly, the possibility that other group members might trigger them to smoke was a frequently stated issue. Focus group members also noted lack of motivation to attend the group, and that the group program may be inaccessible depending on where and when the program was offered. Several suggestions were made as to how to ameliorate the expressed issues related to inaccessibility or lack of attractiveness. Conclusions This study is among the first to gain the perspectives of LGBTQ YYAs on culturally tailored group cessation strategies in Canada. We identified components of group cessation programs that are both favored and not favored among LGBTQ YYAs, as well as suggestions as to how to make group cessation programs more appealing. Implications This study is particularly relevant as smoking cessation programs are one of the most commonly offered and published cessation interventions for the LGBTQ community, yet little is understood in terms of preferences of LGBTQ YYA smokers. Given the disparity in the prevalence of smoking among LGBTQ young people compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, research on effective intervention strategies for this population is needed. Findings from this study can assist practitioners and researchers in designing interventions.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Nicotine Metabolite Ratio (NMR) Prospectively Predicts Smoking Relapse: Longitudinal Findings From ITC Surveys in Five Countries,article,['trans'],"Introduction The ratio of trans 3’-hydroxycotinine (3HC) to cotinine (nicotine metabolite ratio [NMR]) is a biomarker of the rate of nicotine metabolism, with higher NMR indicating faster metabolism. Higher NMR has been found to be associated with higher daily cigarette consumption and less success stopping smoking in cessation trials. This study examines differences in NMR among population-based samples of smokers in the five countries and explores the relationship between NMR and smoking abstinence. Methods Participants (N = 874) provided saliva samples during International Tobacco Control (ITC) surveys in the United States, United Kingdom, Mauritius, Mexico, and Thailand conducted in 2010/2011 with follow-up surveys in 2012/2013. When all samples were received, they were sent to a common laboratory for analysis using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy. Results There was significant variation in NMR across countries (F = 15.49, p < .001). Those who reported smoking at follow-up had a mean NMR of 0.32, compared to a mean NMR of 0.42 in participants who reported that they had stopped (F = 8.93; p = .003). Higher mean NMR values were also associated with longer quit duration (p = .007). There was no substantial difference in NMR between current smokers who made a failed quit attempt and those who made no attempt—both had significantly lower NMR compared to those who quit and remained abstinent. Smokers with a higher NMR were more likely to report that they stopped smoking compared to those with a lower NMR (odds ratio = 2.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 5.68). Conclusions These results suggest faster nicotine metabolizers may be less likely to relapse following a quit attempt. This finding differs from results of clinical trials testing stop smoking medications, where slower metabolizers have been found to be more likely to maintain abstinence from smoking. Implications Results of this study suggest faster nicotine metabolizers may be less likely to relapse following a quit attempt. This finding differs from results of clinical trials testing stop smoking medications, where slower metabolizers have been found to be more likely to maintain abstinence from smoking.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Depression Among Non-Daily Smokers Compared to Daily Smokers and Never-Smokers in the United States: An Emerging Problem,article,['gender'],"Introduction Depression is strongly associated with daily smoking. Yet, little is known about the association between depression and non-daily smoking. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of past-year depression and changes in past-year depression over time among non-daily smokers, compared to daily smokers and never-smokers, overall and stratified by age, gender, income, nicotine dependence, and cigarettes per day. Methods Data were drawn from the National Household Survey on Drug Use (NSDUH), an annual cross-sectional study of persons aged 12 and over (total study population N = 496 805). The prevalence of past-year depression was examined annually among non-daily smokers, daily smokers, and never-smokers from 2005 to 2013 using linear trend analyses. Results Past-year depression was common among 10.10% of non-daily smokers, common among 10.78% of daily smokers, and 5.51% of never-smokers in 2013. The prevalence of depression increased from 2005 to 2013 among non-daily smokers (9.06% vs. 10.10%; p = .034) while there was no significant change in depression over time among daily smokers. Increases in depression among non-daily smokers occurred for both men and women and appear most pronounced youth, those smoking fewer cigarettes, and those without nicotine dependence. Conclusions The prevalence of depression among non-daily smokers was equivalent to daily smokers and nearly twice that among nonsmokers. Depression appears to be increasing over time in non-daily smokers especially among youth, those who smoke less, and those without nicotine dependence. More work on the mental health of non-daily smokers is needed as this is an increasing and understudied group. Implications This is the first study to investigate changes in the prevalence of depression among non-daily smokers compared to daily smokers and never-smokers over the past decade in a nationally representative sample of the United States. The results suggest an increase in depression among non-daily smokers over time that did not similarly occur for daily smokers. Further, there were several subgroups of non-daily smokers among whom depression has increased more rapidly. This study suggests the need for more information about the relationship between depression and non-daily smoking including the impact of depression on quit attempts and outcomes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 Polymorphism Is a Predictor of Smoking Cessation,article,['sex'],"Introduction Smoking cessation has been known to be associated with drinking behaviors, which are influenced by polymorphisms in genes encoding alcohol metabolizing enzymes. The aim was to evaluate the impact of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2, rs671) and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B, rs1229984) polymorphisms together with drinking behaviors on smoking cessation. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study with 1137 former smokers and 1775 current smokers without any cancer at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between 2001 and 2005. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for successful smoking cessation by comparing former smokers (quitters) with current smokers (non-quitters). Results Older age, lower amount of cumulative smoking exposure, lower number of cigarettes per day, younger age of smoking initiation, shorter smoking duration, longer time to first cigarette in the morning, and lower amount of drinking among ever drinkers were predictors of smoking cessation. After careful adjustment for age, sex, smoking patterns, and drinking status, the ORs for smoking cessation among subjects with ALDH2 Glu/Lys and Lys/Lys were 1.02 (95% CI 0.84–1.23) and 1.78 (95% CI 1.23–2.58) compared with those with ALDH2 Glu/Glu, respectively Mediation analyses confirmed that the effect of ALDH2 Lys/Lys on smoking cessation was independent by dinking behaviors. No statistically significant association between ADH1B polymorphism and smoking cessation was observed. Conclusions In our Japanese population, ALDH2 polymorphism predicts smoking cessation, independent by drinking behaviors. Interventions for promoting smoking cessation by ALDH2 polymorphism may be useful in Asian populations. Implications We newly show that subjects with ALDH2 Lys/Lys genotype in a functional polymorphism, rs671, are more likely to quit smoking than those with ALDH2 Glu allele in a Japanese population. Our finding suggests that ALDH2 polymorphism may be useful for promoting smoking cessation in those specific populations as East Asian ones with frequent ALDH2 Lys allele carriers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Depressive Symptoms Predict Current E-Cigarette Use Among College Students in Texas,article,['gender'],"Introduction No studies have examined the longitudinal relationship between e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms among young adults. The main objective of the current study was to establish a potential bi-directional relationship between e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms among college students in Texas, across a 1 year period of time. Methods A survey of 5445 college students in Texas was conducted with 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. A longitudinal cross-lagged model was used to simultaneously examine the bi-directional relationships between current, or past 30-day, e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms across the three study waves. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) with a cutpoint of ≥ 10 to measure elevated depressive symptoms. Covariates included baseline age, gender, college type (2- or 4-year), and other alternative tobacco products used. Results E-cigarette use did not predict elevated depressive symptoms at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. However, depressive symptoms predicted e-cigarette use at both 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Conclusions The current study indicates that depressive symptoms predict subsequent e-cigarette use and not vice versa. Future studies are needed to replicate current findings and also further establish the mechanisms for causality, which could inform Food and Drug Administration regulatory planning. Implications There has been recent evidence for cross-sectional associations between e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms and mental health problems. There have been no studies examining these associations using longitudinal designs. This study established a temporal relationship, such that elevated depressive symptoms predicted e-cigarette use 6 months later among college students.

Using a classic twin design, this study examined genetic and environmental contributions to prevalence of ever having smoked across adolescence among European ancestry cohorts from North America, Europe, and Australia. With substantially more statistical power than prior twin studies, this mega-analysis confirms the rapid and nearly linear increase in ever smoking between the ages of 10 and 19 observed in numerous large-scale epidemiologic studies in the United States and across the world. It also confirms prior observations that as adolescents age, genetic contributions to the liability to smoke increase and familial environment contributions decrease. The identification of sex differences in these models are likely to be due to substantially larger sample sizes in this study. Importantly, the authors find that the relative contributions of genes and environment are broadly consistent across cohorts and continents in spite of differences in prevalence, suggesting a similar etiology.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntx022,"Bierut, Laura J; Johnson, Eric O","Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; Fellows Program, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, Chapel Hill, NC"

This study investigated within-person patterns of cigarette smoking from ages 18 to 50 among a US national sample of high school graduates, focusing on identifying ages of particular importance for smoking involvement change. Aims and Methods Using data from approximately 15,000 individuals participating in the longitudinal Monitoring the Future study, trichotomous measures of past 30-day smoking obtained at 11 time points were modeled using repeated-measures latent class analyses. Sex differences in latent class structure and membership were examined. Results Twelve latent classes were identified: three characterized by consistent smoking patterns across age (no smoking; smoking < pack per day; smoking pack + per day); three showing uptake to a higher category of smoking across age; four reflecting successful quit behavior by age 50; and two defined by discontinuous shifts between smoking categories. The same latent class structure was found for both males and females, but membership probabilities differed between sexes. Although evidence of increases or decreases in smoking behavior was observed at virtually all ages through 35, 21/22 and 29/30 appeared to be particularly key for smoking category change within class. Conclusions This examination of latent classes of cigarette smoking among a national US longitudinal sample of high school graduates from ages 18 to 50 identified unique patterns and critical ages of susceptibility to change in smoking category within class. Such information may be of particular use in developing effective smoking prevention and intervention programming. Implications This study examined cigarette smoking among a national longitudinal US sample of high school graduates from ages 18 to 50 and identified distinct latent classes characterized by patterns of movement between no cigarette use, light-to-moderate smoking, and the conventional definition of heavy smoking at 11 time points via repeated-measures latent class analysis. Membership probabilities for each smoking class were estimated, and critical ages of susceptibility to change in smoking behaviors were identified.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,E-Cigarette Susceptibility as a Predictor of Youth Initiation of E-Cigarettes,article,['sex'],"Introduction Identifying youth at risk for future e-cigarette use is critical for informing prevention efforts. Prior research established measures of susceptibility to conventional cigarettes, and this study aimed to examine whether items adapted for e-cigarette susceptibility predicted subsequent e-cigarette use among never e-cigarette users.  Methods Longitudinal school-wide survey data were collected from middle and high school students in Fall 2013 (wave 1) and Spring 2014 (wave 2). Among never e-cigarette users at wave 1 (n = 1720), e-cigarette susceptibility was measured by two items assessing anticipation of experimenting with e-cigarettes in the future and willingness to use an e-cigarette if offered by a best friend. Logistic regression models examined susceptibility as a predictor of e-cigarette initiation and past 30-day use 6 months later at wave 2. Models were clustered by school and controlled for sex, age, race, SES, and other substance use (alcohol, marijuana, and other tobacco). Results In total, 8.9% (n = 153) of youth initiated e-cigarettes and 3.7% (n = 63) reported past 30-day use at wave 2. E-cigarette susceptibility was a significant independent predictor of subsequent initiation (OR = 4.27, 95% CI = 3.12–5.85) and past 30-day e-cigarette use (OR = 5.10, 95%CI = 3.38–7.68) 6 months later. Susceptible youth were more likely to be male, older, and have used alcohol, marijuana, or other tobacco products. Conclusions These findings provide initial support for adapting two susceptibility items to identify adolescents at risk for future e-cigarette use. Identifying strategies that are effective for targeting susceptible youth and preventing future e-cigarette use will be critical areas for future research. Implications More than a quarter of the sample who reported both a willingness to try e-cigarettes if offered by a best friend and anticipation of experimenting with e-cigarettes in the future went on to try e-cigarettes within the academic year, suggesting that targeting this group will be critical for preventing youth e-cigarette initiation. There were notable demographic differences between susceptible and non-susceptible youth, suggesting targeting e-cigarette prevention efforts to male students who have used other substances may be especially important for preventing future e-cigarette use. Research is needed to determine the most effective prevention strategies to reach susceptible youth.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Biological and Psychological Factors Associated With Smoking Abstinence Six Years Post-Stroke,article,['sex'],"Introduction Tobacco use is a public health problem causing high morbidity and mortality, including stroke. This study evaluates predictive factors of smoking cessation in the long term after stroke. Methods We followed a cohort of 110 consecutive smokers with stroke for up to 6 years. Sociodemographic variables, stroke severity, insular involvement, stage of change in smoking habit before stroke and disruption of addiction variable (smoking cessation, absence of relapses, having stopped smoking without difficulties and not having had urge) were evaluated. Results Twenty patients died during follow-up and two patients were lost leaving a final cohort of 88 patients. The prevalence of smoking cessation in the remaining population was 65.9% post-stroke, 54.9% at 3–6 months, 40.9% at 1 year and 37.5% at 6 years. Prevalence was significantly higher in patients with insular involvement during the first year of follow-up, but not at 6 years. Disruption immediately after stroke (OR = 10.1; 95% CI = 2.5 to 40.1) and intention to change before having the stroke (OR = 4.8; 95% CI = 1.0 to 23.0) were predictors of abstinence at 6 years after adjusting for age, sex and stroke severity at baseline. When tobacco abstinence at the 1 year follow-up was included in the model, this factor was the best predictor of tobacco abstinence at 1 year (OR = 10.5; 95% CI = 2.2 to 49.4). Conclusions Intention of change, having the disruption criteria, and abstinence 1 year after stroke were predictors of abstinence at 6 years. An insular lesion in the acute phase of stroke does not determine the tobacco use status at 6 years. Implications This study is the first prospective investigation with a cohort of stroke patients to examine the long-term influence of biological and psychological factors on smoking cessation. Tobacco abstinence 1 year after stroke was the strongest predictor of abstinence at 6 years of follow-up. The effect of the insular cortex lesion on tobacco cessation, which had been relevant during the first year, no longer had an influence over the longer period studied here.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Sex Differences in Subjective Responses To Moderate Versus Very Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes,article,['sex'],"Introduction Men and women may be differentially sensitive to the acute perceptual responses to smoking cigarettes that vary in nicotine content (“dose”) but are matched on non-nicotine constituents. Methods Dependent adult smokers (43 M, 31 F) took four controlled puffs from Spectrum research cigarettes that were moderate (16–17 mg/g) or very low (0.4 mg/g) in nicotine content, and matched on “tar.” To ensure reliable responses, each cigarette was administered singly five times in random order under blind conditions, with one or the other provided every 15 minutes over a 2.5-hour session following overnight abstinence. Subjective perceptions (eg, “satisfying”, “how much nicotine”) were rated after each cigarette. Results Subjective ratings differed due to cigarette nicotine content, as expected, and did so differentially between men and women. The interaction of nicotine content by sex was significant for most rated subjective perceptions of the cigarette, as multivariate analyses showed that differences due to nicotine content were highly significant for men (p < .001) but only marginal for women (p = .08). Conclusions Relative to men, women’s subjective responses to acute smoking are less sensitive to differences in cigarette nicotine content. To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of sex differences in response to very carefully controlled doses of smoked nicotine per se. Further research should examine possible sex differences in nicotine dosing administered by other smoked and nonsmoked methods, as well as the developmental pattern of these differences during onset and during cessation of dependent smoking. Implications Subjective perceptions of smoking cigarettes varying in nicotine contents differ between men and women. These results with research cigarettes are similar to other studies with carefully dosed nicotine administration by other means, supporting the notion that women, relative to men, are less sensitive to pharmacological factors and more sensitive to nonpharmacological factors in acute cigarette smoking. Future studies are warranted to examine sex differences in other responses to controlled nicotine intake via smoking, and via other smoked and nonsmoked methods of administering nicotine doses.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Association Between State Value-Added Taxes and Tobacco Use in India—Evidence From GATS and TCP India Survey,article,['gender'],"Introduction State value-added taxes (VAT) on tobacco products have been increased significantly in recent years in India. Evidence on how these VATs were associated with smoking is highly needed. Methods State bidi and cigarette VAT rates were linked to Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) India 2009–2010 and Tobacco Control Policy (TCP) India Survey waves 1 (2010–2011) and 2 (2012–2013), respectively. These linked data were used to analyze the associations between bidi VAT rates and bidi smoking, between cigarette VAT rates and cigarette smoking, and between the two VAT rates and dual use of bidis and cigarettes. Weighted logistic regressions were employed to examine GATS cross-sectional data, whereas generalized estimating equations (GEE) were employed to examine longitudinal TCP data. We further stratified the analyses by gender. Results A 10% increase in cigarette VAT rates was associated with a 6.5% (p < .001) decrease in dual use of cigarettes and bidis among adults and a 0.9% decrease (p < .05) in cigarette smoking among males in TCP; and with a 21.6% decrease (p < .05) in dual use among adults and a 17.2% decrease (p < .001) in cigarette smoking among males in GATS. TCP analyses controlling for state fixed effects are less likely to be biased and indicate a cigarette price elasticity of −0.44. As female smoking prevalence was extremely low, these associations were nonsignificant for females. Conclusions Higher state cigarette VAT rates in India were significantly associated with lower cigarette smoking and lower dual use of cigarettes and bidis. Increasing state VAT rates may significantly reduce smoking in India. Implications Both Global Adult Tobacco Survey and Tobacco Control Policy (TCP) India datasets suggest that higher state cigarette value-added tax rates were significantly associated with lower male cigarette smoking and lower dual use of cigarettes and bidis among all adults in India. TCP analyses indicate a cigarette price elasticity of −0.44. As shown in this study, state tobacco taxes in the current taxation system are likely effective in reducing smoking. Given this, a future central goods and service tax (GST) system could consider keeping states’ authority in implementing local tobacco taxes or designing a GST system that is equally or more effective in reducing tobacco use.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Meta-Analysis of Brief Tobacco Interventions for Use in Integrated Primary Care,article,['gender'],"Introduction The integration of behavioral health services in primary care settings presents an opportunity to enhance the delivery of tobacco cessation interventions in the primary care setting, but guidance on evidence-based treatments for tobacco use disorder that fits the brief format of integrated primary care (IPC) is limited. This meta-analysis summarizes the outcomes of brief behavioral interventions targeting tobacco use that can be delivered in IPC settings. Methods A literature search was conducted to locate empirical studies examining tobacco cessation interventions that could be implemented in an IPC setting. A random effects meta-analytic approach was utilized with odds ratios as the effect size. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which a number of study, participant, and intervention characteristics affected treatment outcome. Results A total of 36 studies were included (n = 12975 patients). Patients in the intervention groups exhibited significantly greater odds of smoking cessation compared with those in the comparison groups (OR = 1.78, p < .001). Subgroup analyses did not reveal significant sources of heterogeneity attributable to moderators such as methodological quality, gender, bioverification, follow-up time period, or intervention characteristics (such as setting, type, or length of intervention). Conclusions Brief tobacco cessation interventions that can be delivered in IPC settings were found to be effective. Future research in this area might evaluate ways to improve the dissemination and implementation of these types of interventions in IPC settings. Implications The integration of behavioral health services into primary care presents a unique opportunity to increase the delivery of tobacco cessation interventions, as behavioral health providers in these settings are experts in behavior change interventions and may have more time to deliver these interventions than primary care providers. Results from the current meta-analysis demonstrate that brief tobacco cessation interventions that can be implemented in the IPC setting are effective. Future research in this area might examine ways to improve the dissemination and implementation of brief interventions for tobacco use in IPC settings.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,"US Adult Cigar Smoking Patterns, Purchasing Behaviors, and Reasons for Use According to Cigar Type: Findings From the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, 2013–2014",article,['sex'],"Introduction The US cigar market is diverse, yet until recently most research studies and tobacco surveillance systems have not reported behavioral and related outcomes by cigar type. Methods The 2013–2014 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study collected data separately for filtered cigars (FCs), cigarillos, and traditional cigars, which were further distinguished as premium or nonpremium. Descriptive statistics for adult established current smokers of each cigar type and cigarettes were calculated for demographic characteristics, tobacco use patterns, purchasing behaviors and reasons for use. Adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) using a marginal predictions approach with logistic regression assessed correlates of dual cigar and cigarette smoking. Results Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, and poverty status of smokers varied according to cigar type. Daily cigar smoking prevalence and number of cigars smoked per day were higher for FCs (37.3%; median: 1.6 cigars/day, respectively), than all other cigar types (6.7%–25.3%, all p < .01; 0.1–0.4 cigars/day, all p < .01, respectively); daily smoking and cigars per day were similar for nonpremium cigars and cigarillos (p = .11; p = .33, respectively). Cigarette smoking was twice as common among smokers of nonpremium cigars, cigarillos, and FCs (58.0%–66.0%) than among premium cigars (29.9%). Among current cigar smokers, FC smokers (APR = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09–1.39), other tobacco product users (APR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.15–1.41), and those with a GED/high school diploma or less (APR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.09–1.33) were more likely to also smoke cigarettes. Conclusion User characteristics, cigar smoking patterns, and dual smoking with cigarettes varied by cigar type highlighting the importance of adequately describing the cigar type studied and, where appropriate, differentiating results by cigar type. Implications Despite the diversity of the cigar market place, historically many research studies and tobacco surveillance systems have treated cigars as a single product type. This study describes similarities and differences in the user characteristics, tobacco use patterns, and purchasing behaviors of premium, nonpremium, cigarillo, and filtered cigar smokers. To enhance tobacco regulatory science, sufficient descriptions of the cigar type(s) studied and, where appropriate, differentiation of the particular cigar type(s) studied should be undertaken to improve the interpretation of study findings, understanding of cigar use patterns and related behaviors and future approaches to reducing cigar-attributable morbidity and mortality.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Poorest of Poor Suffer the Greatest Burden From Smokeless Tobacco Use: A Study From 140 Countries,article,['gender'],"Background The full extent of global smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and its association with key demographic factors such as gender, place of residence, and household or country income status is not yet known. Methods The global burden of SLT use among adults was estimated using nationally representative data of 140 countries by gender and country income group. Countries were grouped in Group 1 (low and low-middle income countries combined) and Group 2 (upper middle and high income countries combined). The number of male and female SLT users was calculated using prevalence and population estimates of corresponding age groups. Results Nearly one in 10 males and one in 20 females used SLT in some form. SLT use prevalence was significantly higher among males (p < .001) and females (p < .001) in Group 1 countries compared with their counterparts in Group 2 countries. However, for both Group 1 (p < .01) and Group 2 (p < .01), males were more likely to use SLT than females. Nearly 91% of a total 356 million adult SLT users resided in Group 1 countries, with 81.6% in countries of WHO South-East Asia region (SEAR). In SEAR and African region, SLT use was higher in rural areas and poorest communities. Conclusion The majority of the burden of SLT use is on lower and lower middle income countries with the greatest burden on the poorest segments of the population in these countries. Implications This study brings the comprehensive information on epidemiology of SLT use among adults at global level. Ninety percent of SLT burden is in low and low-middle income group of countries and more specifically among the poorest group in such countries. These countries need to have strategies to implement different provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The program in such countries should be targeted towards the poorest communities for effective SLT control.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Time Trends in Smoking Onset by Sex and Race/Ethnicity Among Adolescents and Young Adults: Findings From the 2006–2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,article,['sex'],"Introduction During the 2000s the number of adolescents who became new smokers in the United States declined while the number of young adults who did so increased. However, we do not know among which demographic groups these changes occurred. Methods We analyzed data from the 2006 to 2013 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (n = 180 079). Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess annual trends in smoking onset and log-binomial regression models to assess changes over time in the risk of smoking onset among young adults (18- to 25-years-old) relative adolescents (12- to 17-years-old). Results From 2006 to 2013, the rate of onset among young adults (6.3%) was greater than among adolescents (1.9%). Time trends demonstrated that annual declines in smoking onset occurred among white young adult males and females. Rates of smoking onset increased among black and Hispanic young adult males with a lower rate of decline among black and Hispanic young adult females. There was a greater risk of smoking onset among young adults relative to adolescents that did not change over time. Conclusions Smoking onset is becoming more concentrated in the young adult than adolescent years. Despite this trend, there were annual declines in young adult smoking onset but not uniformly across racial/ethnic groups. More effective strategies to prevent young adult smoking onset may contribute to a further decline in adult smoking and a reduction in tobacco-related health disparities. Implications Smoking onset is becoming more concentrated in the young adult years across sex and racial/ethnic groups. The United States may be experiencing a period of increasing age of smoking onset and must develop tobacco control policies and practices informed by these changes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Effects of Sexual Orientation on the Relationship Between Victimization Experiences and Smoking Status Among US Women,article,"['bisexual', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'sexual minority', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction This study examined the relationships between experiences of childhood and adulthood victimization and current smoking among heterosexual and sexual minority women. The main hypothesis was that victimization experiences would predict current smoking status. Further, we hypothesized that the effect of childhood victimization on self-reported smoker status would be mediated by adult victimization. Methods Data are from two studies conducted in the United States that used similar methods and questionnaires in order to conduct a comparative analysis of women based on sexual orientation. Data from Wave 1 (2000–2001) of the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women (CHLEW) study and from Wave 5 (2001) of the National Study of Health and Life Experiences of Women (NSHLEW) study were used in these analyses. Results Twenty-eight percent of the sample reported current smoking. Victimization experiences were common, with 63.4% of participants reporting at least one type of victimization in childhood and 40.2% reporting at least one type in adulthood. Women who identified as heterosexual were less likely to be victimized during childhood than were women who identified as lesbian or bisexual. Adult victimization had a significant effect on current smoker status, and the effect of childhood victimization on smoker status was mediated by adult victimization. When examined by sexual orientation, this indirect relationship remained significant only among bisexual women in the sample. Conclusions Study findings make a valuable contribution to the literature on victimization and health risk behaviors such as smoking. Given the negative and long-term impact of victimization on women, strategies are needed that reduce the likelihood of victimization and subsequent engagement in health risk behaviors such as smoking. Implications The study findings make a valuable contribution to the literature on sexual minority women’s health on the influence of victimization on health risk behaviors. With the goal of reducing the likelihood of adult victimization and subsequent engagement in health risk behaviors, programs and policies aimed at preventing victimization of women are warranted. Providers and community health agencies should assess and target physically and sexually abused sexual minority youth for mental health intervention with the goal of interrupting the progression from childhood victimization to adult victimization and subsequent engagement in health risk behaviors.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Frequent Experience of LGBQ Microaggression on Campus Associated With Smoking Among Sexual Minority College Students,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'gender', 'gender minority', 'lesbian', 'lgbq', 'queer', 'questioning', 'sexual and gender minority', 'sexual minorities', 'sexual minority']","Introduction Lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer/questioning (LGBQ) microaggressions refer to often-unintentional insults, assaults, and invalidations that denigrate sexual minorities. While experiencing hostile discrimination and violence has previously been associated with elevated rates of smoking cigarettes for LGBQ college students, the relationship between LGBQ microaggressions and smoking is unknown. Methods Data from a national anonymous online survey of sexual and gender minority college students were used to examine the relationship between past month cigarette smoking and interpersonal LGBQ microaggressions. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the relationship between smoking and frequent (chronic) experiences of microaggressions, using a hierarchical procedure to control for demographics, predictors of smoking, and academic factors. Results Past year frequent LGBQ microaggression was reported by 48% of respondents and was more common among students who smoked in past 30 days. Experiencing past year physical violence was reported by 15% and did not differ by smoking status. Past year frequent experience of microaggressions was associated with increased odds of 1.72 (95% CI 1.03–2.87) for past 30-day smoking after adjusting for age, gender, race, socioeconomic indicators, alcohol misuse, physical violence, as well as academic stress and engagement. Conclusions The results indicate that frequently experiencing LGBQ microaggressions is a risk factor for LGBQ college students smoking cigarettes. The mechanisms underlying this relationship require additional research, as does identifying positive coping strategies and institutional strategies to address LGBQ microaggressions on campuses. Tobacco control efforts should consider the impact of microaggression on the social environment for the prevention and treatment of tobacco use among LGBQ individuals. Implications Microaggressions related to sexual minority identity include subtle forms of discrimination experienced during daily interactions that can create hostile and stressful social environments for a socially disadvantaged group. Prior research has demonstrated that LGBQ college students have higher rates of cigarette smoking, and that experiencing identity-based violence is a risk factor. This study revealed that experiencing frequent LGBQ microaggressions on college campus is associated with increased likelihood of current smoking among LGBQ college students.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Sexual and Gender Minority College Students and Tobacco Use in Texas,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'gender', 'gender minority', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'queer', 'sexual and gender minority', 'transgender']","Introduction Most research regarding sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations is limited to examination of cigarette or general tobacco use or does not examine heterogeneity across SGM groups other than lesbian or gay and bisexual individuals. This study examined differences in the odds of current use and age of initiation of five tobacco/nicotine products among three groups of SGM young adults who self-identified as (1) gay or lesbian, (2) bisexual, and (3) queer, transgender, or “other,” compared to their heterosexual peers. Methods Participants were 4252 college students aged 18–29 years from 24 colleges in Texas who completed an online tobacco use survey. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the odds of SGM participants currently using each tobacco product. Multilevel linear regression models were used to examine the association of current product users’ SGM status with self-reported age of each product’s initiation. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and accounted for students clustered within each college. Results At least one SGM group had significantly greater odds of currently using every tobacco product type compared to heterosexual participants, except hookah. There were few differences across groups in age of initiation. However, queer, transgender, and “other-” identified participants initiated e-cigarettes 1.34 years younger than heterosexual participants, and bisexual participants initiated smokeless tobacco 3.66 years younger than heterosexual participants. Conclusions Findings highlight some significant tobacco use disparities among SGM young adults compared to their heterosexual peers. Longitudinal studies with larger group sizes will identify prospective predictors of sustained SGM-related tobacco use disparities. Implications This study extends the current literature by including the sexual and gender minority identity options of queer, transgender, and “other,” highlighting disparities in tobacco use between young adults in these subgroups compared to their heterosexual peers, particularly in noncigarette tobacco product use. Findings underscore the need for the Food and Drug Association and other health agencies to tailor health communication efforts specific to sexual and gender minority populations pertaining to the risks and harms surrounding tobacco product use.

Methods Participants (N = 52; Mage = 42.8; 55.8% Black/African American) were recruited from the local community. Identity facets were measured by the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale (LGBIS). Dependence motives were measured by the Brief Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives. Linear multiple regressions were calculated with the predictors of seven LGBIS subscales for primary and secondary dependence motives, respectively. Results Primary dependence motives (core nicotine dependence features) were predicted by affirmation of LGB identity (β = 0.44). Secondary dependence motives (eg, taste, cognitive/affective enhancement) were predicted by uncertainty of LGB identity (β = 0.43). Conclusions LGB identity affirmation was associated with primary dependence motives, suggesting that a positive view of one’s sexual orientation is a risk factor for dependence. It may be that identity affirmation is related to stronger involvement with the LGB community, which has smoking-friendly norms. Identity uncertainty was associated with secondary dependence motives; this unique identity challenge may represent a stressor contributing to smoking dependence. Findings can help explain the higher rate of smoking in LGB populations and offer avenues to better tailor smoking cessation interventions. Implications The current study is the first to examine multidimensional aspects of LGB identity in explaining smoking dependence motives among LGB adults. Results reveal that LGB identity challenges are associated with dependence motives, suggesting that interventions targeting these challenges may be help reduce LGB smoking disparities. Specifically, reducing identity uncertainty may help reduce smoking dependence. Though identity affirmation was a smoking dependence correlate, it is counterproductive to reduce affirmation, given its association with other positive health outcomes. Rather, interventions to change LGB community norms around smoking appear warranted, given the documented high overlap between affirmation and community affiliation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Reduced Thalamus Volume May Reflect Nicotine Severity in Young Male Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction Nicotine acts as an agonist at presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and to facilitate synaptic release of several neurotransmitters including dopamine and glutamate. The thalamus has the highest density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, which may make this area more vulnerable to the addictive effects of nicotine. However, the volume of thalamus abnormalities and the association with smoking behaviors in young smokers remains unknown. Methods Thirty-six young male smokers and 36 age-, gender- and education-matched nonsmokers participated in the current study. The nicotine dependence severity and cumulative effect were assessed with the Fagerström test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and pack-years. We used subcortical volume analyses method in FreeSurfer to investigate the thalamus volume differences between young smokers and nonsmokers. Correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between thalamus volume and smoking behaviors (pack-years and FTND) in young smokers. Results and Conclusions Relative to nonsmokers, the young smokers showed reduced volume of bilateral thalamus. In addition, the left thalamus volume was correlated with FTND in young smokers. It is hoped that our findings can shed new insights into the neurobiology of young smokers. Implications In this article, we investigated the changes of thalamus volume in young male smokers compared with nonsmokers. Reduced left thalamus volume was correlated with FTND in young smokers, which may reflect nicotine severity in young male smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Genome-Wide Association Study of Heavy Smoking and Daily/Nondaily Smoking in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL),article,['sex'],"Introduction Genetic variants associated with nicotine dependence have previously been identified, primarily in European-ancestry populations. No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been reported for smoking behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos in the United States and Latin America, who are of mixed ancestry with European, African, and American Indigenous components. Methods We examined genetic associations with smoking behaviors in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (N = 12 741 with smoking data, 5119 ever-smokers), using ~2.3 million genotyped variants imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3. Mixed logistic regression models accounted for population structure, sampling, relatedness, sex, and age. Results The known region of CHRNA5, which encodes the α5 cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit, was associated with heavy smoking at genome-wide significance (p ≤ 5 × 10–8) in a comparison of 1929 ever-smokers reporting cigarettes per day (CPD) > 10 versus 3156 reporting CPD ≤ 10. The functional variant rs16969968 in CHRNA5 had a p value of 2.20 × 10–7 and odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 for the minor allele (A); its minor allele frequency was 0.22 overall and similar across Hispanic/Latino background groups (Central American = 0.17; South American = 0.19; Mexican = 0.18; Puerto Rican = 0.22; Cuban = 0.29; Dominican = 0.19). CHRNA4 on chromosome 20 attained p < 10–4, supporting prior findings in non-Hispanics. For nondaily smoking, which is prevalent in Hispanic/Latino smokers, compared to daily smoking, loci on chromosomes 2 and 4 achieved genome-wide significance; replication attempts were limited by small Hispanic/Latino sample sizes. Conclusions Associations of nicotinic receptor gene variants with smoking, first reported in non-Hispanic European-ancestry populations, generalized to Hispanics/Latinos despite different patterns of smoking behavior. Implications We conducted the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of smoking behavior in a US Hispanic/Latino cohort, and the first GWAS of daily/nondaily smoking in any population. Results show that the region of the nicotinic receptor subunit gene CHRNA5, which in non-Hispanic European-ancestry smokers has been associated with heavy smoking as well as cessation and treatment efficacy, is also significantly associated with heavy smoking in this Hispanic/Latino cohort. The results are an important addition to understanding the impact of genetic variants in understudied Hispanic/Latino smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Serum Cotinine and Hemoglobin A1c Among a National Sample of Adolescents Without Known Diabetes,article,['sex'],"Introduction National data suggest tobacco smoke is positively associated with higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) among adults. Our objective was to examine the association between serum cotinine and HbA1c among adolescents without known diabetes. Methods We assessed adolescents 12–19 years old (N = 11550) who participated in the 1999–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We applied sampling weights while performing multiple linear regression analyses. Results The prevalence of serum cotinine indicative of no tobacco smoke exposure (TSE, <0.05 ng/mL) was 43.2%, passive TSE (0.05–2.99 ng/mL) was 38.9%, and active TSE (>3 ng/mL) was 17.9% in our sample. Mean (± standard error) HbA1c in participants with no TSE was 5.16% (±0.01), passive TSE was 5.16% (±0.01), and active TSE was 5.14% (±0.01). No differences in HbA1c were found between TSE groups including sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, income, and physical activity or the fully adjusted model with waist circumference. We found cotinine × sex (p = .01) and cotinine × age (p = .02) interactions. There was an association between cotinine and HbA1c for males but not females. Within males, participants with cotinine ≥3 ng/mL (5.26 ± 0.02) had higher mean HbA1c than those with cotinine 0.05–2.99 ng/mL and <0.05 ng/mL (both 5.20 ± 0.01, p ≤ .02). The negative association between age and HbA1c was stronger for participants with cotinine ≥3 ng/mL than participants with cotinine <0.05 ng/mL. Conclusion No linear association was found between HbA1c and serum cotinine in adolescents overall after adjusting for potential confounders. Differences between TSE groups were found in males. Future research in adolescents should examine chronic TSE over time to examine the potential for development of type 2 diabetes. Implications TSE has been associated with increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes among adults. It is unclear if this relationship holds in adolescents. We examined the association between serum cotinine and HbA1c in adolescents without known diabetes who completed the 1999–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Although no association was found between serum cotinine and HbA1c overall while controlling for potential confounding factors, we observed interaction effects that are indicative of TSE influencing HbA1c differentially by sex and age. Reducing TSE in adolescents should be a priority for future tobacco control efforts.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Environmental Tobacco Exposure and Urinary Cotinine Levels in Smoking and Nonsmoking Adolescents,article,['sex'],"Objective We aimed to evaluate the association between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and urinary cotinine levels in current adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. The secondary objective was to explore the association between ETS exposure and nicotine dependence in adolescent smokers. Methods Using the results from a validation study for the 2012 Global Youth Tobacco Survey in Mexico, we quantified urinary cotinine levels in adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. We fitted a multivariate regression model to assess the association between household exposure to ETS and cotinine levels in adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. In addition, using the questionnaire’s answers for morning cravings, we fitted a multivariate Poisson regression model to explore the association between household ETS exposure and nicotine dependence in adolescent smokers. Results For each day of household ETS exposure, cotinine levels increase by 5% in adolescent smokers compared to a 2% increase in nonsmokers, adjusting for the number of cigarettes smoked per week, age and sex (exp(β) 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.00, 1.10]; p = .041). Morning cravings increase 11% for each day of household ETS exposure adjusting for the number of cigarettes smoked per week, age and sex (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.11; 95% CI [0.99, 1.25]; p = .064). Conclusions There is an association between ETS exposure and cotinine levels, and ETS may contribute to nicotine dependence in adolescent smokers. If confirmed, avoiding ETS exposure could prove helpful for addiction control and quitting in adolescents. Implications Evidence suggests that ETS increases cotinine levels in nonsmokers and adult smokers. However, no study has explored the association between ETS exposure and cotinine levels and addiction in adolescent smokers. This paper provides evidence of an association between ETS exposure and cotinine levels in adolescent smokers: each day of environmental tobacco smoke exposure at home increased cotinine levels by 5% among smokers. In addition, morning cravings in adolescent smokers increased 11% for every day of ETS exposure. ETS exposure is a significant source of nicotine for adolescent smokers and could play an important role in addiction.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Sex and Age Specific Projections of Smoking Prevalence in Spain: A Bayesian Approach,article,['sex'],"Objectives To project future smoking prevalence rates in Spain by sex and age groups using Bayesian methods and to estimate the probability of a 30% relative reduction between 2010 and 2025. Methods We used the data from the Spanish National Health Surveys (2003, 2006, and 2011) to obtain information about current and former smoking. We reconstructed annual smoking rates from 1989 through 2011 by sex and 5-year age groups. The prevalence were projected for the period 2012–2025 using a Bayesian logistic binomial model and estimated the probability to achieve the 30% relative reduction endorsed by the WHO. We calculated the 95% credible interval (CrI) of the posterior distribution, which includes a 95% of the distribution of potential smoking prevalences. Results In men, the projections show a decline for crude (−2.64% annually, 95% CrI: −3.32; −1.97) and adjusted (−2.50%, 95% CrI:−3.14; −1.87) prevalence. In women, the projections show a decline for crude prevalence (−0.36%, 95% CrI: −1.02; −0.30)) and the age-adjusted prevalence (−1.02%, 95% CrI: −1.61, −0.47). By age groups, the decline is greater among women aged 15–39 years (−3.92%, 95% CrI: −4.92; −2.96)) while for women aged 40–64 years an increase (1.84%, 95% CrI: 1.06; 2.58) is expected. In men, the probability to achieve the WHO target is 0.728 and in women is less than 0.001. The age group 15–39 shows the highest probability to achieve the target. Conclusions The results suggest smoking prevalence will decrease during 2012–2025 in all age groups for both sexes except for women aged 40–64. We found that the WHO target of a 30% reduction in prevalence is likely to be achieved overall and in the 15–39 years age groups for both sexes, but not achieved for older women and it is uncertain whether it will be achieved for older men. These results highlight the need to strengthen public health interventions that focus on reducing tobacco use in adult women aged 40–64 years old. Implications We project a decrease in smoking prevalence in during 2012–2025 except for women aged 40–64.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Characteristics of Hookah Tobacco Smoking Sessions and Correlates of Use Frequency Among US Adults: Findings From Wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study,article,['gender'],"Introduction Hookah tobacco smoking has increased in the United States. However, information on hookah use frequency and other characteristics of hookah use is limited. Methods Investigators analyzed data from Wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort study of US youth and adults. Our analysis draws on baseline data from adult (ages ≥18 years) ever (N = 10 624) and past year (n = 3947) hookah users. Bivariate and regression analyses were conducted to identify associations between demographics, use characteristics, and hookah use frequency. Results Overall, 16.4% of adults reported ever smoking tobacco from a hookah. Of those, 31.9% reported smoking hookah within the past year. Among 3947 past-year hookah tobacco smokers, 10.7% were daily/weekly users, 13.7% were monthly users, 42.1% smoked every couple of months, and 33.5% smoked about once a year. Among daily/weekly hookah users, 66% were young adults (ages 18–24 years). When comparing daily/weekly hookah users to those who smoked every couple of months, more frequent hookah use was associated with younger age, male gender, a greater number of times the hookah is refilled during a session, fewer people sharing, and hookah ownership. Conclusion Although there were few demographic differences between daily/weekly users and less frequent hookah tobacco smokers, some notable differences in use behaviors exist among use frequency groups. Unlike other tobacco products, hookah is often smoked communally, over an extended time period. A detailed understanding of hookah user characteristics and experiences could inform hookah-specific measures, messaging, and regulations. Implications To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to characterize hookah use frequency, session length, and other hookah use experiences using a nationally representative sample of US adult hookah smokers. Understanding characteristics of hookah tobacco smokers, their use experiences, and patterns of hookah use frequency would be useful in assessing risks for hookah tobacco dependence at the population level. Additionally, identifying variation in use behaviors of hookah tobacco smokers could be used to inform the development of strategies to reduce and prevent hookah tobacco use, such as tobacco regulations or public education efforts, particularly among young adults.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Geographical Inequality in Tobacco Control in China: Multilevel Evidence From 98 058 Participants,article,['gender'],"Background We investigated the spatial patterning and correlates of tobacco smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, smoking in public places, workplace smoking prohibition, pro- and counter-tobacco advertisements in mainland China. Methods Choropleth maps and multilevel models were used to assess geographical variation and correlates of the aforementioned outcome variables for 98 058 participants across 31 provinces of China in 2010. Results Current tobacco smoking prevalence was higher in the central provinces for men and in the north eastern provinces and Tibet for women. Secondhand smoke was higher for both genders in Qinghai and Hunan provinces. Workplace tobacco restrictions was higher in the north and east, whereas smoking in public places was more common in the west, central, and far northeast. Protobacco advertising was observed in public places more often by men (18.5%) than women (13.1%). Men (35.5%) were also more likely to sight counter-tobacco advertising in public places than women (30.1%). Awareness of workplace tobacco restrictions was more common in affluent urban areas. Lower awareness of workplace tobacco restrictions was in less affluent urban and rural areas. Sightings of tobacco smoking in public places was highest in restaurants (80.4% for men, 75.0% for women) and also commonly reported in less affluent urban and rural areas. Exposure to secondhand smoke was lower among women (but not men) where workplace tobacco restrictions was more common and higher regardless of gender in areas where smoking in public places was more commonly observed. Conclusions Geographical and gender-sensitive targeting of tobacco prevention and control initiatives are warranted. Implications This study demonstrates spatial patterning of China’s 300 million smokers across the country that are different for men and women. Many of the factors that influence tobacco use, such as pro- and counter-advertising, also vary geographically. Workplace smoking restrictions are more commonly reported among individuals with higher educational attainment, but this not does appear to translate into reduced exposure to secondhand smoke. There is a need to intervene in other contexts, especially in restaurants and on public transport. Geographically targeted and gender-sensitive policy is required to advance effective tobacco control and prevention of noncommunicable diseases across all of China.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Parental Smoking and Adult Offspring’s Smoking Behaviors in Ethnic Minority Groups: An Intergenerational Analysis in the HELIUS Study,article,['gender'],"Introduction To understand smoking behaviors among ethnic minority groups, studies have largely focused on societal factors, with little attention to family influences. Yet studies among majority groups have identified parental smoking as an important risk factor. It is unknown whether this applies to ethnic minority groups. We investigated the association between parental smoking and adult offspring’s smoking behaviors among ethnic minority groups with an immigrant background. Methods We used data from the Healthy Life in an Urban Setting study from Amsterdam (the Netherlands) from January 2011 to December 2015. The sample consisted of 2184 parent-offspring pairs from South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Turkish, Moroccan, and Ghanaian origin. We collected self-reported smoking data: current status, duration of exposure to parental smoking, number of daily cigarettes, heavy smoking ( > 10 cigarettes/day), and nicotine dependency (using the Fagerström Test). Analyses were stratified by offspring’s age, cohabitation with parent, education (parent/offspring), offspring’s cultural orientation, and gender concordance within pairs. Logistic regression was used. Results Overall, parental smoking was associated with offspring’s smoking behaviors (eg, current smoking: odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.79–3.03), with little ethnic variation. We found dose-response associations between exposure to parental smoking and offspring’s smoking. The associations were similar across different strata but stronger in gender-concordant pairs (3.16; 2.12–4.51 vs. 1.73; 1.15–2.59 in gender-discordant pairs; p-value for interaction .017). Conclusions Parental smoking is associated with offspring’s smoking behaviors in ethnic minority groups across different strata but particularly in gender-concordant pairs. Similar to majority groups, family influences matter to smoking behaviors in ethnic minority groups. Implications Our findings have deepened our understanding of smoking behaviors among ethnic minority groups. Future studies should simultaneously consider societal factors and parental influences, to comprehensively understand their impact on smoking among ethnic minority groups. Also, smoking patterns among family members should be addressed in individual counselling, irrespective of ethnicity.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Network Analysis of Intrinsic Functional Brain Connectivity in Male and Female Adult Smokers: A Preliminary Study,article,['sex'],"Background The goal of this study was to conduct a preliminary network analysis (using graph-theory measures) of intrinsic functional connectivity in adult smokers, with an exploration of sex differences in smokers. Methods Twenty-seven adult smokers (13 males; mean age = 35) and 17 sex and age-matched controls (11 males; mean age = 35) completed a blood oxygen level-dependent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Data analysis involved preprocessing, creation of connectivity matrices using partial correlation, and computation of graph-theory measures using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox. Connector hubs and additional graph-theory measures were examined for differences between smokers and controls and correlations with nicotine dependence. Sex differences were examined in a priori regions of interest based on prior literature. Results Compared to nonsmokers, connector hubs in smokers emerged primarily in limbic (parahippocampus) and salience network (cingulate cortex) regions. In addition, global influence of the right insula and left nucleus accumbens was associated with higher nicotine dependence. These trends were present in male but not female smokers. Conclusions Network communication was altered in smokers, primarily in limbic and salience network regions. Network topology was associated with nicotine dependence in male but not female smokers in regions associated with reinforcement (nucleus accumbens) and craving (insula), consistent with the idea that male smokers are more sensitive to the reinforcing aspects of nicotine than female smokers. Implications Identifying alterations in brain network communication in male and female smokers can help tailor future behavioral and pharmacological smoking interventions.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Rapid Nicotine Metabolite Ratio and Successful Quitting: Acceptable Explanation,article,['trans'],"Drs. Fix and colleagues examined the relationship between nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) and smoking abstinence. The ratio of trans 3’-hydroxycotinine to cotinine was calculated as a biomarker of NMR. Although higher NMR was associated with higher daily cigarette consumption and considered to be less success for smoking cessation, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of smokers with a higher NMR against those with a lower NMR for successful quitting was 2.48 (1.23–4.99). The authors concluded that faster nicotine metabolizers might be less likely to relapse following a quit attempt, which was inconsistent with data from past clinical trials.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Samoan Smokers Talk About Smoking and Quitting: A Focus Group Study,article,['gender'],"Introduction Samoa, like other Pacific Island countries, faces a persistent challenge to reduce smoking use with relatively limited resources. As a signatory to the WHO FCTC, Samoa is obligated to introduce measures to reduce tobacco use and is currently trialing a text message smoking cessation programme (mCessation) to achieve this outcome. Cigarettes remain relatively cheap and are widely available, but little is known about how smoking is initiated or why and how people quit smoking in the Samoa. Methods Six focus groups with smokers and ex-smokers were conducted in Apia, Samoa. Groups were homogenous according to age, gender and smoking status. Focus groups were conducted in Samoan and transcribed and translated to English for analysis. Results Smoking is initiated most commonly in late teens and early twenties and most frequently in (non-family) social contexts. Smoking reflects a widely held (mis)perceptions of tangible benefits, including aiding feelings of strength and energy, relief from indigestion and as a means to accelerate the effects of alcohol. Smoking was deeply connected to social life in Samoa among friends and for some, with family members. Drivers to quit originate out of concern regarding health effects, concern for family and the costs of purchasing tobacco. Conclusions Smoking is well entrenched in Samoan society; efforts to reduce smoking need to be based on implicit understanding of Samoan cultural norms and priorities around family, social networks and culture. Efforts to support quitting are important, alongside other well validated measures to reverse the trajectory of smoking related disease. Implications This study offers an insight into smoking as a behavior and as cultural practice perceived by smokers and non-smokers in Samoa. A thorough understanding of smoking behaviors and cessation patterns is critical in efforts to reduce smoking especially in resource-limited settings. The results from this study was used to inform the development of a Samoan mHealth smoking cessation programme.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Power of Product Innovation: Smokers’ Perceptions of Capsule Cigarettes,article,['gender'],"Introduction Since being brought to market in 2007, cigarettes with capsules in the filter that can be burst to change the flavor have had remarkable global success, highlighting the importance of product innovation for tobacco companies. Very few studies have explored how these products are perceived by smokers however. This paper sought to address this gap by exploring smokers’ awareness of cigarettes with one or two flavor-changing capsules in the filter and the appeal of these products. Methods Twenty focus groups were conducted in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 2015 with current smokers (N = 120), segmented by age (16–17, 18–24, 25–35, 36–50, >50), gender, and social grade. Results Awareness, use and appeal of capsule cigarettes was greater among younger adults (16–35 years), who showed most interest in these products. Those who perceived capsules positively mentioned multiple benefits: the ability to burst the capsule, convenience of being able to share cigarettes among menthol and nonmenthol smokers, better taste, fresher breath, reduced smell, and greater discretion. It was suggested that capsule cigarettes, particularly the double capsule cigarette (which had two differently flavored capsules in the filter), would encourage nonsmokers to experiment with smoking and discourage smokers from quitting. Conclusions The findings offer some reasons behind the global growth of the capsule cigarette segment. Implications Cigarettes with flavor-changing capsules in the filter have been one of the most successful product innovations of the last decade for tobacco companies. They have received very little academic attention however. Employing focus groups with 120 smokers aged 16 and over, we found that capsule cigarettes held most appeal to, and were considered to be targeted at, younger people, with it suggested that these products would encourage initiation and discourage cessation. This study provides some understanding of how these products are viewed by smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Patterns and Correlates of Multiple Tobacco Product Use in the United States,article,['sex'],"The emergence of new tobacco products in the marketplace over the past several years has contributed to changing patterns of tobacco use in the United States (US). Approximately 40% of youth and adult tobacco users in the US used multiple tobacco products (polytobacco use) in 2013–2014. Diverse factors associated with polytobacco use in the US include younger age, male sex, lower levels of educational attainment, binge-drinking, prior quit attempts, later onset of first tobacco use, first use of tobacco being a noncombustible tobacco product, and high sensation-seeking. Different factors may be associated with different polytobacco use patterns, as suggested by an analysis of 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) data that found that as the number of tobacco products used increased, nicotine dependence and perceived peer tobacco use increased and quit intentions decreased. Some combinations of tobacco product use may be driven by addiction or experimentation, whereas other combinations, such as cigarettes with electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or smokeless tobacco, may reflect partial substitution of cigarettes with another product perceived as less harmful or as a tool for circumventing smoke free laws.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/nty081,"Stanton, Cassandra A; Halenar, Michael J","Westat, Rockville, MD Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC Westat, Rockville, MD"
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Patterns and Profiles of Adolescent Tobacco Users: Results From the Virginia Youth Survey,article,['gender'],"Background Cigarette smoking has decreased to a record low among youth across the United States, including in Virginia. Rates of alternative tobacco use, however, are rising and polytobacco use is common. A better understanding of the shifting use patterns and associated risk factors is important for informing tobacco prevention, cessation, and policy efforts. Methods Weighted data from the 2013 Virginia Youth Survey were used. The sample was limited to 1168 youth who reported past 30-day tobacco use of ≥1 product (cigarettes, smokeless tobacco [smokeless], or cigars/little cigars/cigarillos [cigars]). Latent class analysis categorized individuals based on current tobacco use frequency/intensity. Multivariable multinomial logistic regressions compared classes on demographics, other tobacco-related factors, other substance use, and health/psychosocial factors. Results The five-class model indicated the best fit with classes characterized as “Chippers” (28.0%; high probability of low-frequency/intensity cigarette use), “Moderate Poly-Users” (23.6%; low- to high-frequency/moderate intensity cigarette use; moderate probability smokeless/cigar use), “Cigar Users” (20.9%; no–low-probability cigarette/smokeless use; high-probability cigar use), “Smokeless Users” (17.3%; no–low-probability cigarette/cigar use; moderate–high-probability smokeless use), and “Heavy Poly-Users” (10.4%; daily/high-intensity cigarette use, moderate–high-probability smokeless/cigar use). Classes differed significantly by demographics and inconsistently by other tobacco-related factors. Heavy Poly-Users were more likely to engage in other substance use behaviors, report suicidal ideation, and report being bullied because of gender. Conclusions Classes identified indicate that a large proportion of youth engage in polytobacco use and certain subgroups may be at greater risk for negative health consequences due to elevated psychosocial and behavioral risk factors. Implications These findings suggest distinct patterns of current tobacco use, including a high proportion of youth engaging in polytobacco use. Heavy polytobacco use co-occurs with other health risk behaviors and may be attributed to psychosocial risk factors. Results underscore the need for detailed monitoring of shifting youth tobacco use patterns as well as targeted prevention, cessation, and policy efforts.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Dual Use of E-Cigarettes and Traditional Cigarettes Among Adolescents in Taiwan, 2014–2016",article,['gender'],"Introduction We investigated the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) with traditional cigarettes among adolescents during 2014 to 2016 to identify risk factors for using e-cigarettes only, traditional cigarettes only, or both products. Methods We used cross-sectional data from the Taiwan Global Youth Tobacco Survey, (conducted over a 3-year period by the Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan), which is representative of tobacco use among adolescents aged 12–18 years. The outcome variable was smoking behavior. Dependent variables included gender, grade, monthly income/allowance, parents’ educational level, parents’ smoking status, close friends’ smoking status, use of other tobacco products, contact with cigarette/e-cigarette advertisements, and access to free cigarettes/e-cigarettes. Multinomial regression identify factors influencing the smoking behaviors of adolescents, as manifested in the use of traditional cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only, e-cigarettes with traditional cigarettes, and nonsmoking. Results When weighted to the population, the sample included 1723150 adolescents in 2014, 1691568 adolescents in 2015, and 1627216 adolescents in 2016. The rates averaged over three years were as follows: nonsmoking (91.6%), traditional cigarettes only (5.4%), e-cigarettes only (1.5%), and dual usage (1.6%). Among adolescents in Taiwan, the following were risk factors for dual use: male, older, high monthly allowance, smoking parents, smoking friends, use of other tobacco products, contact with cigarette advertisements, and access to free cigarettes. Conclusions Our results revealed an increase in the number of adolescents using e-cigarettes with traditional cigarettes. We recommend that the government continue smoking cessation programs while maintaining control over advertisements and promotions for tobacco products. Implications This is the first study to examine the dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes among adolescents in Taiwan. This study identified the risk factors of using traditional cigarettes only, using e-cigarettes only, and the dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, with nonsmokers used as a reference group. This study examined the relationship between exposure to cigarette promotions and the use of various tobacco products including the dual use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, both of which have been disregarded in previous studies.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Positive Expectancies for E-Cigarette Use and Anxiety Sensitivity Among Adults,article,['sex'],"Introduction Although e-cigarette use is on the rise among youth and adults, there is little understanding of the individual difference factors at a cognitive level of analysis for e-cigarette beliefs and quit behavior. Method The present investigation sought to test a theoretically driven interactive model of positive expectancies for e-cigarettes and anxiety sensitivity (fear of the consequences of anxiety) among 551 adult e-cigarette users (50.6% female, Mage = 35.2 years, SD = 10.1). Results Results indicated a significant interaction between positive expectancies for e-cigarette use and AS was significantly related to greater perceived benefits of e-cigarette use, greater perceived risk of e-cigarette use, and more serious attempts for trying to quit e-cigarettes. The significant interaction effect for each dependent variable was evident over and above the main effects as well as the covariates of sex, income, education, and concurrent combustible cigarette use. The form of this interaction indicated that e-cigarette users higher in AS who also maintained more positive outcome expectancies for e-cigarette use reported more perceived benefits as well as more perceived risk of e-cigarette use and engaged in more (failed) attempts to quit e-cigarettes. Conclusions Overall, the current data suggest that individual differences in AS and positive expectancies may represent two important factors to consider in e-cigarette beliefs and quit attempts. Implications This study provides the first empirical evidence of a transdiagnostic construct (anxiety sensitivity) in relation to e-cigarette use and how it interplays with positive expectancies for e-cigarette use beliefs and behavior. These novel data suggest that future clinical research may benefit by understanding the potential therapeutic role of anxiety sensitivity and expectancies for e-cigarette use behavior.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Intersection of E-Cigarette Use and Gender on Transitions in Cigarette Smoking Status: Findings Across Waves 1 and 2 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study,article,['gender'],"Introduction Cigarette smokers report using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) to reduce or quit smoking, but findings are mixed regarding the benefit and risk of e-cigarettes in this population, and effects of gender are unknown. Methods The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH; waves 1 and 2; adult interviews) was used to evaluate relationships among wave 1 e-cigarette use (daily, nondaily, never) and gender and their association with transitions (quit vs. current; relapse vs. former) in cigarette smoking status across waves 1 and 2 of the PATH study. Results Daily e-cigarette users had higher odds of quitting smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12 to 2.18) compared with never e-cigarette users. Conversely, daily and nondaily e-cigarette users were at greater risk of smoking relapse (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.94 and OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 0.99 to 3.46, respectively) compared with never e-cigarette users. Women were less likely to quit smoking compared with men independent of e-cigarette use (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59 to 0.99). In stratified analyses, daily or nondaily e-cigarette use did not increase the likelihood of quitting or relapse in women. In men, daily and nondaily e-cigarette users were at greater risk of smoking relapse (OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.49 to 5.86 and OR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.29 to 7.17, respectively) compared with men who were never e-cigarette users. Conclusions Findings identify e-cigarettes as a potential aid for smoking cessation but also as a potential risk for smoking relapse in men only. Overall, women were less likely to quit smoking, and e-cigarette use did not impact their ability to quit or to stay quit. Implications Cigarette smokers report using e-cigarettes to reduce or quit smoking, but findings are mixed regarding the benefit and risk of e-cigarettes in this population. Using data from the newly available PATH (waves 1 and 2; adult interviews), our findings identify e-cigarettes as a potential aid for smoking cessation but also identify e-cigarettes as a potential risk for smoking relapse in men only. These findings may have implications for the regulation of e-cigarettes by the Food and Drug Administration and the benefit–cost ratio of e-cigarette use in smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Exposure to the Tobacco Power Wall Increases Adolescents’ Willingness to Use E-cigarettes in the Future,article,['gender'],"Introduction Adolescents’ e-cigarette use is now more prevalent than their combustible cigarette use. Youth are exposed to e-cigarette advertising at retail point-of-sale (POS) locations via the tobacco power wall (TPW), but no studies have assessed whether exposure to the TPW influences susceptibility to future e-cigarette use. Methods The study was conducted in the RAND Store Lab (RSL), a life-sized replica of a convenience store developed to experimentally evaluate how POS advertising influences tobacco use risk under simulated shopping conditions. In a between-subjects experiment, 160 adolescents (M age = 13.82; 53% female, 56% white) were randomized to shop in the RSL under one of two conditions: (1) TPW located behind the cashier (n = 80); or (2) TPW hidden behind an opaque wall (n = 80). Youths rated willingness to use e-cigarettes (“If one of your best friends were to offer you an e-cigarette, would you try it?”; 1 = definitely not, 10 = definitely yes) before and after exposure. Linear regression assessed differences in pre-post changes in willingness to use across conditions. Results Ever-use of e-cigarettes was 5%; use of cigarettes was 8%; use of both e-cigarettes and cigarettes was 4%. There were no differences between TPW conditions on these or other baseline variables (eg, age, gender). Compared to the hidden condition, TPW exposure was associated with greater increases in willingness to use e-cigarettes in the future (B = 1.15, standard error [SE] = 0.50, p = .02). Conclusions Efforts to regulate visibility of the TPW at POS may help to reduce youths’ susceptibility to initiating e-cigarettes as well as conventional tobacco products like cigarettes. Implications Past work suggests that exposure to the TPW in common retail settings, like convenience stores, may increase adolescents’ susceptibility to smoking cigarettes. This experimental study builds upon prior research to show that exposure to the TPW at retail POS similarly increases adolescents’ willingness to use e-cigarettes in the future. Efforts to regulate the visibility of the TPW in retail settings may help to reduce youths’ susceptibility to initiating nicotine and tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Electronic Cigarette Use and Understanding Among a National Sample of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Smokers,article,['sex'],"Introduction Adult daily smoking prevalence in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population is 2.8 times that of other Australians. There is little data on prevalence of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We measured e-cigarette use and beliefs about their harmfulness in national samples of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers and of all Australian smokers. Methods The Talking About the Smokes project interviewed a nationally representative quota sample of 1301 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers between August 2013 and August 2014. The Australian Wave 9 survey of the long-running International Tobacco Control Project interviewed 1093 smokers between February and May 2013. Estimates for all Australian smokers were standardized to the age and sex distribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers. Results Fewer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander than all Australian smokers had tried an e-cigarette (21% vs. 30%). This was in part because of more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers having not heard of e-cigarettes. Fewer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers than all Australian smokers agreed that e-cigarettes are less harmful than conventional cigarettes (22% vs. 50%). Conclusions Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers have used e-cigarettes. However, there is considerable misunderstanding about the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared with conventional cigarettes, in part because of the tight regulatory environment in Australia. Implications The study describes e-cigarette use and understanding in national samples of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers and of all Australian smokers. Only small studies have reported on e-cigarette use in this high smoking prevalence population. Fewer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers than all Australian smokers had tried an e-cigarette and fewer agreed that e-cigarettes are less harmful than conventional cigarettes. Australian governments, health authorities, health professionals, and e-cigarette regulations should provide clearer messages that e-cigarettes are less harmful.

Methods A prospective randomized design was used to evaluate the added benefits of an LGBT culturally targeted Courage to Quit (CTQ-CT) smoking cessation treatment (N = 172) compared with the standard intervention (CTQ; N = 173). The smoking cessation program consisted of six treatment sessions combined with 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy. The primary smoking cessation outcome was 7-day point prevalence quit rates. Secondary outcomes examined included changes in nicotine dependence, nicotine withdrawal, cigarettes per day, smoking urges, self-efficacy, and readiness to quit. Results Overall quit rates were 31.9% at 1 month, 21.1% at 3 months, 25.8% at 6 months, and 22.3% at 12 months. Quit rates did not differ between treatment groups [1 month OR = 0.81 (0.32, 2.09), 3 months OR = 0.65 (0.23, 1.78), 6 months OR = 0.45 (0.17, 1.21), 12 months OR = 0.70 (0.26, 1.91)]. Compared with baseline levels, all secondary smoking cessation outcomes measured were improved at 1 month and were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Compared with the CTQ, the CTQ-CT intervention was more highly rated on program effectiveness (d = 0.2, p = .011), intervention techniques (d = 0.2, p = .014), the treatment manual (d = 0.3, p < .001), and being targeted to the needs of LGBT smokers (d = 0.5, p < .0001). Conclusions LGBT smokers receiving the CTQ intervention achieved smoking cessation outcomes in the range reported for other demographic groups. Cultural targeting improved the acceptability of the intervention but did not confer any additional benefit for smoking cessation outcomes. Implications Study results have implications for understanding the benefits of culturally targeted compared with nontargeted smoking cessation interventions for improving smoking cessation outcomes among LGBT smokers. Shorter and longer term 7-day point prevalence quit rates associated with the targeted and nontargeted interventions were modest but comparable with other group-based interventions delivered in a community setting. Although cultural targeting improved the overall acceptability of the intervention, no added benefits were observed for the culturally targeted intervention on either the primary or secondary outcomes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Socioeconomic Differences in Smoking and Cessation Across a Period of Rapid Economic Growth in an Upper-Middle-Income Country,article,['gender'],"Introduction Higher smoking rates and lower cessation rates among the poor compared to the rich are evident in high-income countries. In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), many of which are in the early stages of tackling the tobacco epidemic, more knowledge is required of the socioeconomic inequalities in smoking. This is especially the case for upper-middle-income countries, where smoking prevalence is highest. This study examines trends in the socioeconomic gradient in smoking and cessation among adults across a period of rapid economic development in Malaysia, an LMIC with an upper-middle-income economy. Methods The socioeconomic trends in smoking were analyzed using data from cross-sectional National Health and Morbidity Surveys for the years 1996, 2006, and 2011. Household per capita income was used as a measure of socioeconomic position. As a measure of inequality, the concentration index that quantified the degree of socioeconomic inequality in a health outcome was computed. Smoking was assessed in current and former smokers. The study population was examined by gender, region, and age group. Results This study found a trend of an increasingly higher smoking prevalence among the poor and higher cessation rates among the rich. With the exception of younger women in Peninsular Malaysia, the socioeconomic gradient in current smoking is concentrated among the poor. For former smokers, especially men, distributions across the years were mostly concentrated among the rich. Conclusion It is important to ensure that health policies, programs, and interventions consider the potential impact of the socioeconomic patterning in smoking on equity in health. Implications Findings on the socioeconomic gradient in smoking and cessation from Malaysia across a period of rapid economic development will contribute to addressing the paucity of knowledge on the socioeconomic gradient of smoking and cessation in other progressing LMICs. This study provides evidence from an upper-middle-income country, of an increasing trend of smoking among the poor and an increasing trend of cessation rates among the rich, particularly for men. We found opposing trends for younger adult women in the more developed, Peninsular Malaysia. More rich young women were found to have taken up smoking compared to socioeconomically less advantaged young women.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Psychometric Evaluation of the E-cigarette Dependence Scale,article,['sex'],"Introduction Psychometrically sound measures of e-cigarette dependence are lacking. Methods We modified the PROMIS Item Bank v1.0—Smoking: Nicotine Dependence for All Smokers for use with e-cigarettes and evaluated the psychometrics of the 22-, 8-, and 4-item adapted versions, referred to as The E-cigarette dependence scale (EDS). Adults (1009) who reported using e-cigarettes at least weekly completed an anonymous survey in summer 2016 (50.2% male, 77.1% White, mean age 35.81 [10.71], 66.4% daily e-cigarette users, 72.6% current cigarette smokers). Psychometric analyses included confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency, measurement invariance, examination of mean-level differences, convergent validity, and test-criterion relationships with e-cigarette use outcomes. Results All EDS versions had confirmable, internally consistent latent structures that were scalar invariant by sex, race, e-cigarette use (nondaily/daily), e-liquid nicotine content (no/yes), and current cigarette smoking status (no/yes). Daily e-cigarette users, nicotine e-liquid users, and cigarette smokers reported being more dependent on e-cigarettes than their counterparts. All EDS versions correlated strongly with one another, evidenced convergent validity with the Penn State E-cigarette Dependence Index and time to first e-cigarette use in the morning, and evidenced test-criterion relationships with vaping frequency, e-liquid nicotine concentration, and e-cigarette quit attempts. Similar results were observed when analyses were conducted within subsamples of exclusive e-cigarette users and duals-users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Conclusions Each EDS version evidenced strong psychometric properties for assessing e-cigarette dependence in adults who either use e-cigarette exclusively or who are dual-users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes. However, results indicated little benefit of the longer versions over the 4-item EDS, which provides an efficient assessment of e-cigarette dependence. Implications The availability of the novel, psychometrically sound EDS can further research on a wide range of questions related to e-cigarette use and dependence. In addition, the overlap between the EDS and the original PROMIS that was developed for assessing nicotine dependence to cigarettes provides consistency within the field.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Hookah Use Among US Youth: A Systematic Review of the Literature From 2009 to 2017,article,['gender'],"Introduction Given the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s authority to regulate hookah, more research is needed to inform regulations intended to prevent youth from using hookah. This systematic review summarizes and assesses the literature related to hookah use among adolescents (11 to ≤18 years of age) in the United States from 2009 to 2017. Methods Database searches yielded 867 peer-reviewed articles. After duplicates were removed, authors reviewed 461 articles for inclusion. Included articles (n = 55) were coded for study themes, study quality, and their relevance to FDA’s research priorities. A qualitative synthesis is presented. Results The following themes were identified: (1) prevalence of hookah use (n = 42), (2) tobacco use transitions (n = 7), (3) sociodemographic correlates (n = 35), (4) psychosocial risk factors (n = 21), (5) concurrent use of other tobacco products (n = 31), (6) concurrent use of other substances (n = 9), and (7) other (n = 15)—which includes low prevalence themes. The qualitative synthesis showed increasing rates of hookah use. Older age, male gender, positive social normative beliefs, higher peer use, as well as lower perceived risk were associated with hookah use. Longitudinal studies of youth hookah use showed bidirectional relationships between use of hookah and other tobacco products. All articles fell within FDA’s research priority related to “behavior,” and three priorities (“impact analysis,” “health effects,” and “toxicity”) have not been explored for hookah use among US youth since 2009. Conclusions The prevalence of hookah use among youth in the United States is increasing, thus more research is needed to inform policies targeted to protect this vulnerable population. Implications This study represents a novel contribution to our understanding of hookah use among youth in the United States from 2009—the year that the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was passed—to 2017. In recent years, hookah has become a more popular tobacco product among US youth; however, to date, no systematic reviews of hookah use among this population exist. Results highlight implications for future US FDA regulatory policy and identify gaps in research to be addressed in future studies.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Association Between Adolescent Body Mass Index and Adulthood Smoking,article,['sex'],"Introduction Studies increasingly find a prospective association between adolescent weight status and adverse physical health outcomes. However, less is known about the long-term consequences of adolescent body weight on the adoption of health-risk behaviors. This study sought to determine whether adolescent body mass index (BMI) was associated with cigarette smoking in adulthood. Methods Six thousand six hundred eighty-three nonsmoking adolescents were interviewed at baseline (1996, age 11–20) and at follow-up (2008, age 24–32) as part of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health. Logistic and fractional regression models tested the association between adolescent BMI and smoking status and frequency in adulthood. Respondent weight and height were measured at baseline and converted into age and sex-specific BMI z-scores. Being a smoker was defined as smoking at least once in the past 30 days, while smoking frequency was defined as the proportion of days smoked over the past 30 days. Both outcomes were measured at follow-up. Results Adolescent BMI was positively associated with the transition from nonsmoking to smoking 12 years later for women but not men. Adolescent BMI was also positively associated with smoking frequency among women smokers. Both associations persisted after adjusting for established risk factors and were robust to sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Adolescent BMI was strongly associated with increased cigarette smoking behavior in adulthood for women, even after adjusting for important risk factors. Implications Using a large, nationally representative sample, this study found that adolescent BMI was positively associated with smoking behavior during adulthood for women but not men. These results have potentially important public health implications for future smoking rates in the United States, as the prevalence of overweight and obesity among US adolescent females continues to grow. Thus, it may be important for smoking prevention interventions to prioritize overweight adolescent females moving forward.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Prevalence of Smoking and Knowledge About the Hazards of Smoking Among 170 000 Chinese Adults, 2013–2014",article,['gender'],"Introduction Periodic population surveys of smoking behavior can inform development of effective tobacco control strategies. We investigated smoking patterns, cessation, and knowledge about smoking hazards in China. Methods A nationally representative cross-sectional survey recruited 176 318 people aged ≥18 years across 31 provinces of China in 2013–2014, using multi-stage stratified cluster sampling methods. The smoking patterns, cessation, and knowledge about smoking hazards were analyzed, overall and in population subgroups, adjusting for sample selection weight and post-stratification factors. Results Among men, 60.7% were ever-smokers, with proportions of regular, occasional and former smokers being 46.3%, 5.5%, and 8.8% respectively. Among women, only 2.8% had ever smoked. The prevalence of ever smoking in men was higher in rural than urban areas (63.2% vs. 57.6%) and varied from 39.5% to 67.4% across 31 provinces. Among male regular smokers, the mean daily number of cigarettes smoked was 17.8, with mean age at first starting to smoke daily being 20.1 years. Among current smokers, one-third (32.6% men, 32.1% women) had tried to quit before and 36.8% (36.8% men, 35.5% women) intended to quit in the future. Of the Chinese adults, 75.9% recognized that smoking was hazardous, with the proportions believing that smoking could cause lung cancer, heart attack or stroke being 67.0%, 33.2%, and 29.5%, respectively and with 26.0% reporting that smoking could cause all these conditions. Conclusion Among Chinese adults, the smoking prevalence remained high in men but was low in women. In both men and women, knowledge about smoking hazards was poor. Implications This study showed that tobacco smoking remained highly prevalent among adult men in China in 2013–2014. Moreover, men born in recent decades were more likely to start smoking at younger ages and to smoke more cigarettes than those born in previous generations. There was a large regional variation in male smoking prevalence, with the least economically developed regions having higher prevalence. In contrast, few women in China smoked, especially among those born in recent decades. The contrasting smoking patterns in men and women is likely to result in an increasingly large gender disparity in life expectancy in the coming decades.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Pregnancy-Induced Increases in the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio: Examining Changes During Antepartum and Postpartum,article,['trans'],"Introduction Pregnancy-induced increases in nicotine metabolism may contribute to difficulties in quitting smoking during pregnancy. However, the time course of changes in nicotine metabolism during early and late pregnancy is unclear. This study investigated how pregnancy alters the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), a common biomarker of nicotine metabolism among nonpregnant smokers. Methods Urinary NMR (trans-3′-hydroxycotinine [3HC]/cotinine [COT]) was assessed using total (free + glucuronide) and free compounds among women (N = 47) from a randomized controlled trial for smoking cessation who self-reported smoking and provided a urine sample during early pregnancy (M ± SD = 12.5 ± 4.5 weeks’ gestation), late pregnancy (28.9 ± 2.0 weeks’ gestation), and 6 months postpartum (24.7 ± 1.2 weeks since childbirth). Urine samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and NMR were calculated as Total 3HC/Free COT, Free 3HC/Free COT, and Total 3HC/Total COT. Results NMR was significantly higher during early and late pregnancy compared to postpartum and significantly increased from early to late pregnancy as measured by Total 3HC/Free COT (0.76, 0.89, 0.60; all p’s < .05) and Free 3HC/Free COT (0.68, 0.80, 0.51; all p’s < .05). Total 3HC/Total COT did not vary over time (p = .81). Conclusions Total 3HC/Free COT and Free 3HC/Free COT increased in the first trimester and continued to increase throughout pregnancy, suggesting a considerable increase in nicotine metabolism over gestation. Future analyses are needed to interpret the changes in NMR in the context of nicotine pharmacokinetics, as well as its impact on changes in smoking behavior and cessation outcomes. Implications We observed that the NMR was significantly higher as early as 12 weeks’ gestation and increased further as a function of gestational age. Among nonpregnant smokers, elevated NMR is associated with smoking phenotypes such as smoking more cigarettes per day and poorer response to nicotine patch; therefore, pregnancy-induced increases in the NMR may contribute to smoking during the first trimester of pregnancy and reducing or quitting smoking may become more challenging as the rate of nicotine metabolism accelerates over the course of pregnancy.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Comparative Effectiveness of Varenicline and Nicotine Replacement Therapy for Smoking Cessation in Older and Younger Smokers: A Prospective Cohort in Taiwan,article,['sex'],"Introduction The effectiveness of varenicline compared with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in achieving smoking cessation in older smokers has not been investigated. This study prospectively compared the effectiveness of varenicline relative to NRT in smokers aged 25–54 years and separately in smokers aged 55 years or older. Methods Among 13 397 smokers participating in the Smoking Cessation Program in Taiwan, 2012–2015, 6336 (19.2%, aged ≥55) received varenicline and 7061 received NRT patch or gum (23.2%, aged ≥55). Participants self-reported smoking behaviors by phone interview after 6 months. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 7-day, 1-month, and 6-month point-prevalence abstinence. Age-specific models adjusted for sex, education, marital status, smoke-years, nicotine dependence, medical institution, clinic visit number, and duration of medication received. Results Among smokers aged 25–54 years, varenicline users had a greater point-prevalence abstinence than NRT users (e.g., 7-day point-prevalence: 34.0% vs. 23.5%), with adjusted OR ranging from 1.23 (CI: 1.09–1.39; 6-month point-prevalence) to 1.37 (CI: 1.24–1.50; 1-month point-prevalence). Among smokers aged 55 years or older, point-prevalence was similar for varenicline and NRT users (e.g., 7-day point-prevalence: 32.3% vs. 33.1%), and ORs did not suggest that varenicline has greater effectiveness than NRT. Sex and level of nicotine dependence did not modify the age-specific effectiveness of varenicline relative to NRT. Conclusions Varenicline did not offer greater effectiveness in achieving abstinence than NRT for smokers 55 years or older, whereas it was more effective than NRT in smokers aged 25–54 years. These findings highlighted the need for age-specific approaches for effective tobacco control. Implications In this prospective investigation of a national cohort, older smokers (aged ≥55 years) who received varenicline did not have a greater point-prevalence abstinence after 6 months compared with those who used NRT patch or gum. Younger smokers (aged 25–54 years) who received varenicline had a greater likelihood of abstinence than NRT users. Sex and nicotine dependence did not modify the age-specific effectiveness of varenicline relative to NRT patch or gum. Age-appropriate approaches for effective tobacco control are needed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Examining the Association Between Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior and Sport Participation With E-Cigarette Use and Smoking Status in a Large Sample of Canadian Youth",article,['gender'],"Introduction Youth e-cigarette use is common worldwide, but the profile of e-cigarette users compared with tobacco users is unclear. This study examines how sport participation and activity levels among youth differ between e-cigarette users and smokers. Methods Using Canadian data from 38977 grade 9 to 12 students who participated in Year 3 (2014–15) of the COMPASS study, logistic regression models were used to examine the likelihood of sport participation and activity level based on e-cigarette use and smoking status. Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to examine subgroup differences by gender. Results E-cigarette users are more likely to participate in intramural, competitive, and team sports compared to non-users. Current and former smokers are less likely to participate in those sports than non-smokers. Youth e-cigarette users are more likely than non-users to meet the physical activity guidelines. Current smokers are more likely than non-smokers to undertake physical activity at least 60 min daily but less likely than non-smokers to tone at least 3 times per week. Youth e-cigarette users are less likely than non-users to be sedentary less than 2 h daily. Gender differences among males and females show that male e-cigarettes users drive the general relationship. Conclusion Results suggest that e-cigarette users are more likely to engage in physical activity compared to non e-cigarette users. Youth e-cigarette users are more likely to be physically active while the opposite is true for smokers. Although e-cigarettes may be less harmful to health compared to cigarette smoking, the increased uptake among youth of differing profiles should be considered in prevention efforts. Implications These results highlight the importance of addressing e-cigarette use in youth who undertake health promoting behaviors. Prevention efforts should not focus only on youth who may undertake riskier health habits; e-cigarette prevention programs should go beyond the domain of tobacco control.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Tobacco Advertisement Liking, Vulnerability Factors, and Tobacco Use Among Young Adults",article,"['sex', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction Young adulthood (aged 18–24) is a crucial period in the development of long-term tobacco use patterns. Tobacco advertising and promotion lead to the initiation and continuation of smoking among young adults. We examined whether vulnerability factors moderated the association between tobacco advertisement liking and tobacco use in the United States. Methods Analyses were conducted among 9109 US young adults in the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study wave 1 (2013–14). Participants viewed 20 randomly selected sets of tobacco advertisements (five each for cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco) and indicated whether they liked each ad. The outcome variables were past 30-day cigarette, e-cigarette, cigar, and smokeless tobacco use. Covariates included tobacco advertisement liking, age, sex, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, poverty level, military service, and internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms. Results Liking tobacco advertisements was associated with tobacco use, and this association was particularly strong among those with lower educational attainment (cigarettes, cigars) and living below the poverty level (e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco). Conclusions The association between tobacco advertisement liking and tobacco use was stronger among young adults with lower educational attainment and those living below the poverty level. Policies that restrict advertising exposure and promote counter-marketing messages in this population could reduce their risk. Implications This study shows that liking tobacco advertisements is associated with current tobacco use among young adults, with stronger associations for vulnerable young adults (ie, lower education levels and living below the poverty level). Findings suggest a need for counter-marketing messages, policies that restrict advertising exposure, and educational interventions such as health and media literacy interventions to address the negative influences of tobacco advertisements, especially among young adults with a high school education or less and those living below the poverty level.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Harm Perceptions of Menthol and Nonmenthol Cigarettes Differ by Brand, Race/Ethnicity, and Gender in US Adult Smokers: Results from PATH Wave 1",article,['gender'],"Introduction Harm perceptions of menthol cigarettes may contribute to their appeal and use. African-Americans, women, and younger smokers disproportionately use menthol cigarettes, and may misperceive harm of menthol cigarettes. Methods Data were from Wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Weighted analyses of current adult smokers (18 and older) were used to estimate the correlates of menthol smoking among all cigarette brands and separately for the top three cigarette brands (Newport, Camel, and Marlboro). Adjusted models examined the main effect of menthol smoking on harm perceptions of one’s own brand of cigarette and interactions with race/ethnicity, age, and gender. Results Menthol cigarettes were used by nearly 40% of current smokers, although the prevalence of menthol smoking differed across the top three brands (94% Newport, 46% Camel, and 18% Marlboro). Among menthol smokers, 80% perceived their cigarette as equally harmful, 14% perceived their brand as more harmful, and 7% perceived their brand as less harmful. In adjusted models, menthol smokers were more likely than nonmenthol smokers to misperceive their own brand as more harmful than other brands (compared to no difference in harm). Race and gender emerged as moderators of the association between menthol brand preference and harm perceptions. Conclusions In adjusted analyses, menthol smokers were more likely than nonmenthol smokers to perceive their brand as more harmful than other brands, with differences by sub-groups who disproportionately use menthol. Implications Menthol cigarettes have been historically marketed with messages conveying lower harm than other cigarettes. Little is known about how contemporary adult menthol smokers perceive the harm of their usual brand, and potential differences by race, gender, and young adult versus older adult age group. After adjusting for other factors, menthol smokers were more likely than nonmenthol smokers to perceive their cigarette brand as more harmful than other brands. Further, the association between menthol smoking and harm perceptions differed by race and gender, but not by age group (young adult vs. older adult). This type of large-scale study identifies critical links between menthol smoking and harm perceptions among vulnerable smokers that will inform regulatory actions designed to decrease smoking-related harm.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Temporal Trends of Sources of Cigarettes Among US High School Students: 2001–2015,article,['sex'],"Introduction Restricting the supply of cigarettes to youth plays an important role in reducing youth smoking. Methods The study included data from 8 years of the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) from 2001 to 2015 with 99572 high school students less than 18 years old. Data were weighted to provide national estimates of the temporal trends of cigarette sources. Each cigarette source was analyzed by a separate multivariable logistic regression model and the linear trend odds ratio (aOR) was adjusted by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking frequency. Results The current smoking prevalence among US high school students less than 18 years of age declined from 26.9% in 2001 to 9.9% in 2015. Among current smokers, we found an overall downward trend of buying cigarettes in a store (aOR = 0.98, confidence interval [CI] = [0.96–1.00]) and an overall upward trend of getting them “some other way” (aOR = 1.03, CI = [1.01–1.05]). The prevalence of purchasing cigarettes in a store significantly declined among smokers aged 16–17, male smokers, white smokers, and daily smokers, but not among other categories. The prevalence of getting cigarettes “some other way” significantly increased across all groups except Hispanic smokers and medium-level or daily smokers. Conclusions The proportion of high school students reporting that they bought cigarettes from a store has been declining over the years, while the proportion of high schoolers reporting that they got cigarettes “some other way” has been increasing. The temporal trends also varied by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking frequency. Implications Patterns of high school student access to cigarettes have changed from 2001 to 2015, with access from “some other way” becoming more prevalent. The differences in cigarette acquisition by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking frequency highlight the importance of implementing tailored policies and interventions to reduce youth access to cigarettes and prevent youth from smoking.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) View it Differently Than Non-LGBT: Exposure to Tobacco-related Couponing, E-cigarette Advertisements, and Anti-tobacco Messages on Social and Traditional Media",article,"['lgbt', 'non-lgbt']","Background LGBT populations use tobacco at disparately higher rates nationwide, compared to national averages. The tobacco industry has a history targeting LGBT with marketing efforts, likely contributing to this disparity. This study explores whether exposure to tobacco content on traditional and social media is associated with tobacco use among LGBT and non-LGBT. Methods This study reports results from LGBT (N = 1092) and non-LGBT (N = 16430) respondents to a 2013 nationally representative cross-sectional online survey of US adults (N = 17522). Frequency and weighted prevalence were estimated and adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results LGBT reported significantly higher rates of past 30-day tobacco media exposure compared to non-LGBT, this effect was strongest among LGBT who were smokers (p < .05). LGBT more frequently reported exposure to, searching for, or sharing messages related to tobacco couponing, e-cigarettes, and anti-tobacco on new or social media (eg, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) than did non-LGBT (p < .05). Non-LGBT reported more exposure from traditional media sources such as television, most notably anti-tobacco messages (p = .0088). LGBT had higher odds of past 30-day use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cigars compared to non-LGBT, adjusting for past 30-day media exposure and covariates (p ≤ .0001). Conclusions LGBT (particularly LGBT smokers) are more likely to be exposed to and interact with tobacco-related messages on new and social media than their non-LGBT counterparts. Higher levels of tobacco media exposure were significantly associated with higher likelihood of tobacco use. This suggests tobacco control must work toward reaching LGBT across a variety of media platforms, particularly new and social media outlets. Implications This study provides important information about LGBT communities tobacco-related disparities in increased exposure to pro-tobacco messages via social media, where the tobacco industry has moved since the MSA. Further, LGBT when assessed as a single population appear to identify having decreased exposure to anti-tobacco messages via traditional media, where we know a large portion of tobacco control and prevention messages are placed. The study points to the need for targeted and tailored approaches by tobacco control to market to LGBT using on-line resources and tools in order to help reduce LGBT tobacco-related health disparities. Although there have been localized campaigns, only just recently have such LGBT-tailored national campaigns been developed by the CDC, FDA, and Legacy, assessment of the content, effectiveness, and reach of both local and national campaigns will be important next steps.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Sexual Orientation Discrimination and Tobacco Use Disparities in the United States,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'same-sex', 'sex', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minorities', 'sexual minority', 'sexual orientation']","Introduction Differences in tobacco/nicotine use by sexual orientation are well documented. Development of interventions requires attention to the etiology of these differences. This study examined associations among sexual orientation discrimination, cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder (TUD) in the United States. Methods We used data from the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions based on in-person interviews with a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized US adults. Approximately 8.3% of the target population was estimated to have same-sex sexual attraction, 3.1% had at least one same-sex sexual partner in the past-year, and 2.8% self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Results Sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual identity were significantly associated with cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 TUD. Risk of all tobacco/nicotine outcomes was most pronounced for bisexual adults across all three sexual orientation dimensions. Approximately half of sexual minorities who identified as lesbian or gay and one-fourth of those who identified as bisexual reported past-year sexual orientation discrimination. Sexual minorities who experienced high levels of past-year sexual orientation discrimination had significantly greater probability of past-year cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and TUD relative to sexual minorities who experienced lower levels of sexual orientation discrimination or no discrimination. Conclusions Sexual minorities, especially bisexual adults, are at heightened risk of cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 TUD across all three major sexual orientation dimensions. Tobacco prevention and cessation efforts should target bisexual adults and consider the role that sexual orientation discrimination plays in cigarette smoking and treatment of TUD. Implications Differences in tobacco/nicotine use by sexual orientation are well documented, but little is known about differences across all three sexual orientation dimensions (attraction, behavior, and identity) or the origins of these differences. This study is the first to show that differences in tobacco/nicotine use across the three sexual orientation dimensions for respondents who were exclusively heterosexually-oriented were minimal, but varied more substantially among sexual minority women and men across the three sexual orientation dimensions. Sexual minorities who experienced high levels of past-year sexual orientation discrimination had significantly greater probability of cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Oral Contraceptives and Cigarette Smoking: A Review of the Literature and Future Directions,article,['sex'],"Introduction Evidence continues to mount indicating that endogenous sex hormones (eg, progesterone and estradiol) play a significant role in smoking-related outcomes. Although approximately one out of four premenopausal smokers use oral contraceptives (OCs), which significantly alter progesterone and estradiol levels, relatively little is known about how OCs may influence smoking-related outcomes. Thus, the goal of this review article is to describe the state of the literature and offer recommendations for future directions. Methods In March 2017, we searched seven databases, with a restriction to articles written in English, using the following keywords: nicotine, smoker(s), smoking, tobacco, cigarettes, abstinence, withdrawal, and craving(s). We did not restrict on the publication date, type, or study design. Results A total of 13 studies were identified. Three studies indicated faster nicotine metabolism in OC users compared to nonusers. Five of six laboratory studies that examined physiological stress response noted heightened response in OC users compared to nonusers. Three studies examined cessation-related symptomatology (eg, craving) with mixed results. One cross-sectional study observed greater odds of current smoking among OC users, and no studies have explored the relationship between OC use and cessation outcomes. Conclusions Relatively few studies were identified on the role of OCs in smoking-related outcomes. Future work could explore the relationship between OC use and mood, stress, weight gain, and brain function/connectivity, as well as cessation outcomes. Understanding the role of OC use in these areas may lead to the development of novel smoking cessation interventions for premenopausal women. Implications This is the first review of the relationship between oral contraceptives (OCs) and smoking-related outcomes. The existing literature suggests that the use of OCs is related to increased nicotine metabolism and physiological stress response. However, the relationship between OC use and smoking-related symptoms (eg, craving) is mixed. Further, no published data were available on OC use and smoking cessation outcomes. Therefore, we recommend additional research be conducted to characterize the relationship between OC use and smoking cessation outcomes, perhaps as a function of the effect of OC use on mood, stress, weight gain, and brain function/connectivity.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Cigarette Smoking Progression Among Young Adults Diagnosed With ADHD in Childhood: A 16-year Longitudinal Study of Children With and Without ADHD,article,['sex'],"Introduction Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for smoking cigarettes, but there is little longitudinal research on the array of smoking characteristics known to be prognostic of long-term smoking outcomes into adulthood. These variables were studied into early adulthood in a multisite sample diagnosed with ADHD combined type at ages 7–9.9 and followed prospectively alongside an age- and sex-matched local normative comparison group (LNCG). Methods Cigarette smoking quantity, quit attempts, dependence, and other characteristics were assessed in the longitudinal Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) eight times to a mean age of 24.9 years: ADHD n = 469; LNCG n = 240. Results In adulthood, the ADHD group had higher rates of daily cigarette smoking, one or more quit attempts, shorter time to first cigarette of the day, and more severe withdrawal than the LNCG. The ADHD group did not appear to have better smoking cessation rates despite a higher proportion quitting at least once. Smoking quantity and nicotine dependence did not differ between groups. The ADHD group reported younger daily smoking onset and faster progression from smoking initiation to daily smoking across assessments. Finally, ADHD symptom severity in later adolescence and adulthood was associated with higher risk for daily smoking across assessments in the ADHD sample. Conclusions This study shows that ADHD-related smoking risk begins at a young age, progresses rapidly, and becomes resistant to cessation attempts by adulthood. Prevention efforts should acknowledge the speed of uptake; treatments should target the higher relapse risk in this vulnerable population. Implications Although childhood ADHD predicts later smoking, longitudinal studies of this population have yet to fully characterize smoking behaviors into adulthood that are known to be prognostic of long-term smoking outcome. The current study demonstrates earlier and faster progression to daily smoking among those with a childhood ADHD diagnosis, as well as greater risk for failed quit attempts. Prevention efforts should address speed of smoking uptake, while treatments are needed that address smoking relapse risk. The current study also demonstrates ADHD symptom severity over development increases daily smoking risk, implicating the need for continuous ADHD symptom management.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Nicotine Metabolism in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes,article,['trans'],"Introduction Metabolism of nicotine has implications for addiction and may be altered in people with type 2 diabetes. Thus, our objective was to analyze nicotine metabolism in adults with and without type 2 diabetes who smoke. Methods From an existing cross-sectional study, we analyzed nicotine metabolism in urine of 148 smokers, 36 type 2 diabetics (insulin or antidiabetic medication use and/or fasting glucose >126 mg/dL) and 112 non-diabetics. Nicotine metabolism was quantified as the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) = trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC) divided by cotinine (COT). COT and 3HC were measured in the participant urine by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Generalized linear models were used to assess whether NMR was associated with diabetic status (yes/no). Results Participants categorized as high NMR smoked more cigarettes per day (p = .002) and were more likely to be diabetic (p = .022) compared to low NMR. We found no significant difference in total nicotine equivalents defined as the sum of the nicotine, COT, and 3HC (p > .05). In unadjusted models, NMR was 42.5% higher in diabetics versus non-diabetics (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.9, 79.8; p = .003). In models adjusted for factors significantly different between low versus high NMR participants, mean NMR was 36.5% higher in the diabetics versus non-diabetics (95% CI: 7.8, 72.8; p = .010). Additionally, in models adjusted for known confounders of NMR, NMR was 40.6% higher in diabetics versus non-diabetics (95% CI: 9.9, 80.0; p = .007). Conclusions From these data, we infer that type 2 diabetics metabolize nicotine faster, which may increase the potential for nicotine addiction. Implications Smoking is addictive and this addiction may be related to tobacco metabolism. Individuals with faster metabolism of nicotine tend to smoke more cigarettes for longer periods of time. People with type 2 diabetes may metabolize nicotine faster, which could lead to higher lifetime tobacco burden, increasing the adverse health outcomes associated with increased exposure to tobacco.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Tobacco Industry Denormalization Beliefs in Hong Kong Adolescents,article,['sex'],"Background Tobacco industry denormalization (TID) seeks to expose the industry’s misconducts. Research on TID beliefs, meaning negative attitudes toward the tobacco industry (TI), may inform TID programs, but was limited to western populations. We investigated TID beliefs and their association with smoking and sociodemographic characteristics in Hong Kong adolescents. Methods In a school-based cross-sectional survey of 14214 students (mean age 15.0 years, 51.5% boys), TID beliefs were assessed by two questions: (1) whether the TI was respectable and (2) whether the TI tried to get youth to smoke, each with four options from “definitely no” to “definitely yes.” Smoking susceptibility and behaviors were also assessed. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, perceived family affluence, highest parental education, numbers of co-residing smokers, and school-level smoking prevalence. Results Of all students, 77.6% considered the TI not respectable and 56.6% believed that the TI tried to get youth to smoke. Stronger TID beliefs were inversely associated with smoking susceptibility and behaviors. For example, students considering the TI definitely not respectable (vs. definitely yes) were 56% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 45% to 66%), 49% (95% CI = 41% to 56%), and 53% (95% CI = 36% to 65%) less likely to be susceptible to smoking (among never-smokers) and be ever- and current smokers, respectively. Of all correlates examined, only younger age and having no co-residing smoker were associated with TID beliefs. Conclusions Substantial proportions of Hong Kong adolescents did not hold TID beliefs, but those who did were less likely to smoke. Our results suggest that TID programs may help reduce adolescent smoking. Implications The TI’s misconducts and responsibility for the tobacco epidemic were not well known by Hong Kong adolescents. TID beliefs in this population were inversely associated with smoking. These findings suggest that TID programs in local adolescents may be of value. The investigation into the correlates of TID beliefs found that socioeconomic status and school-level smoking prevalence were not associated with TID beliefs. This suggests that local TID programs targeting adolescents in general, for example, mass-media campaigns, may be more appropriate than those targeting particular schools or selected groups of adolescents.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Widespread Belief That Organic and Additive-Free Tobacco Products are Less Harmful Than Regular Tobacco Products: Results From the 2017 US Health Information National Trends Survey,article,"['gender', 'sexual orientation']","Significance US smokers of Natural American Spirit, a brand marketed as “organic” and “additive-free,” are more likely than other cigarette smokers to believe that their brand might be less harmful than other brands. This article (1) describes the prevalence of belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco is less harmful than regular tobacco products in the US population and (2) describes the sociodemographic characteristics of adults who believe tobacco products with these descriptors are less harmful. Methods Data were drawn from the 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a nationally representative survey of US adults. Logistic regression models were used to examine correlates of the belief that “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than regular tobacco products. Results Overall, 26.7% of US adults and 45.3% of adult smokers believe that “organic” tobacco products are less harmful than regular tobacco products. Similarly, 35.2% of US adults and 47.1% of smokers believe that “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful. When examining gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and smoking status, only age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ~0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97, 0.99 for both outcomes) and smoking status (current vs. never smokers, aOR ~1.78, 95% CI 1.03, 3.07 for both outcomes) were correlates of believing that “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco is less harmful than regular tobacco products. Conclusions Belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than other products is widespread. Younger adults and current smokers are most likely to be misinformed by “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco product descriptors. Implications Belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than other products is widespread among US adults and most prevalent among smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Examining Risk Perceptions Among Daily Smokers Naïve to Reduced Nicotine Content Cigarettes,article,['gender'],"Introduction The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated its interest in reducing the addictiveness of combustible cigarettes by lowering their nicotine content. Delineating risk perceptions of reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes prior to federal regulation may inform the content of future educational campaigns accompanying this policy. Methods Five hundred non–treatment-seeking, daily smokers naïve to RNC cigarettes (63.0% male, 51.6% nonWhite, mean [SD] cigarettes per day = 15.69 [7.58], age = 43.44 [11.46]) completed a 10-item RNC cigarette risk perception questionnaire at baseline in two, unrelated experimental studies. We used multinomial logistic regression models to identify demographic (eg, gender) and smoking-related (eg, nicotine dependence) correlates of RNC cigarette risk perceptions. Results Although the majority of participants did not misperceive RNC cigarettes as less harmful than regular or high nicotine cigarettes, a large portion of the sample held misperceptions about RNC cigarettes’ addictiveness (56.4%) and cessation aid potential (63.4%). More than 20% of the sample reported being unsure about RNC-related risks, especially tar content (51.8%). NonWhite smokers were 2.5 to 3 times more likely to be incorrect about multiple RNC cigarette risks (p = .002–.006). Conclusions If the FDA mandates a reduced nicotine content standard for cigarettes, educational campaigns will be needed to correct misperceptions about RNC cigarettes’ addictiveness and potential to aid cessation as well as inform consumers about their safety risks. Campaigns tailored toward nonWhite smokers may also be needed to correct misperceptions of RNC cigarette risks held by this subgroup. Implications The FDA has stated its interest in reducing cigarettes’ addictiveness by lowering their nicotine content, enabling smokers to quit. Our findings suggest that most smokers who have not used RNC cigarettes do not perceive these products as less addictive or as cessation tools, stressing a need for future educational campaigns to correct these misperceptions. Campaigns are also needed to educate uninformed smokers about RNC cigarettes and should consider targeting messages toward subgroups likely to hold misperceptions about the risks and benefits of using these products (eg, nonWhite smokers).

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Role of Physical Activity in the Association Between Smoking Status and Quality of Life,article,['gender'],"Objectives Nonsmoking status and physical activity have, individually, been shown to be associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The objective of this study was to assess whether the relationship between smoking status and HRQoL is modified or influenced by physical activity. Methods Data were extracted from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey dataset (N = 332680) in 2015. Logistic regression models were used to address study objectives. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), measured using eight domains (general health, physical health, mental health, activity limitations, pain, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and vitality), was regressed on smoking status without and with adjustment for age, race, gender, education, marital status, income, employment, healthcare coverage, comorbidity, body mass index, flu vaccination, alcohol use, and physical activity. Smoking status by physical activity interaction term was added to the adjusted model and evaluated for significance. Results There were significant smoking status by physical activity interaction effects on general health, physical health, activity limitations, and depressive symptoms domains. Among those who exercised, relative differences in the odds of a high HRQoL was smaller between former smokers and nonsmokers and larger between current smokers and nonsmokers when compared to those who did not exercise. Similarly, there were sharper relative differences between those who exercised and those who did not exercise among former smokers than among current smokers. Conclusions Smokers who successfully quit smoking (former smokers) may benefit from enhanced HRQoL that tends towards that of nonsmokers if they adopt physical activity in their daily routine. Implications Behavioral interventions that combine smoking cessation and physical activity may be more effective than either smoking cessation or physical activity alone in improving the quality of life measures such as overall, physical and mental health, and degree of limitation to activities due to poor health. Health care providers can support patients who successfully quit smoking to add exercise to their daily routine with the expectation of enhanced HRQoL.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Gender Differences in Negative Affect During Acute Tobacco Abstinence Differ Between African American and White Adult Cigarette Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction Prior studies have found heightened negative affect following tobacco abstinence in women compared to men. However, experimental work addressing whether these findings generalize across racial groups is scarce. This study investigated whether race (non-Hispanic White vs. non-Hispanic African American) moderated gender differences in abstinence-induced negative affect and smoking behavior. Methods Data were collected from 2010 to 2017 from two separate laboratory studies investigating experimentally manipulated tobacco abstinence. Following a baseline session, adult daily smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day; women: n = 297, 83.8% non-Hispanic African American; men: n = 492, 86.2% non-Hispanic African American) attended two counterbalanced lab sessions (16 hours abstinent vs. non-abstinent) and completed self-report measures of negative affect followed by a laboratory analogue smoking reinstatement task. Results We found a gender × race interaction for several negative affect states and composite negative affect (βs = −.12 to −.16, Ps < .05). Analyses stratified by race showed that non-Hispanic White women compared to non-Hispanic White men exhibited greater abstinence-induced increases in anger, anxiety, and composite negative affect (βs = −.20 to −.29, Ps < .05). No significant gender differences in abstinence-induced negative affect were found for non-Hispanic African American smokers (βs = .00 to − .04, Ps > .05). Conclusion These findings suggest that negative affect during acute tobacco abstinence may be a clinically important and intervenable factor that can inform cessation interventions specifically for non-Hispanic White women smokers. Further empirical exploration of mechanisms underlying interactions of gender and race in tobacco addiction may benefit smoking cessation efforts in non-Hispanic African American women smokers. Implications This study contributes to a scant body of research examining the intersectional influence of race and gender on abstinence-induced negative affect—a central, motivationally prepotent feature of tobacco withdrawal. Using a laboratory-based design to experimentally manipulate abstinence, we provide evidence of a gender × race interaction on negative affect–related withdrawal. Our findings suggest that gender differences in abstinence-induced negative affect observed among non-Hispanic White smokers may not generalize to non-Hispanic African American smokers, highlighting the need for future work to address potential mechanisms underlying the racially discrepant impact of gender on affective tobacco withdrawal.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Smoking and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: A 25-Country Analysis of the Demographic Health Surveys,article,['sex'],"Background Having HIV/AIDS has been associated with a higher prevalence of smoking. Moreover, evidence suggests that people with HIV/AIDS who smoke have poorer treatment and survival outcomes. The HIV–smoking relationship is understudied in sub-Saharan Africa, where tobacco use patterns and HIV prevalence differ greatly from other world regions. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Demographic Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator Surveys, representing 25 sub-Saharan African countries, were pooled for analysis (n = 286850). The association between cigarette smoking and HIV status was analyzed through hierarchical logistic regression models. This study also examined the relationship between smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and HIV status. Results Smoking prevalence was significantly higher among men who had HIV/AIDS than among men who did not (25.90% vs 16.09%; p < .0001), as was smoking prevalence among women who had HIV/AIDS compared with women who did not (1.15% vs 0.73%; p < .001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the odds of smoking among people who had HIV/AIDS was 1.12 times greater than among people who did not when adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic, and sexual risk factors (adjusted OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04% to 1.21%; p < .001). Similarly, multivariate logistic regression revealed that HIV-positive individuals were 34% more likely to use SLT than HIV-negative individuals (adjusted OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.17% to 1.53%). Conclusion Having HIV was associated with a greater likelihood of smoking cigarettes as well as with using SLT in sub-Saharan Africa. These tobacco use modalities were also associated with male sex and lower socioeconomic status. Implications This study shows that in sub-Saharan Africa, as in more studied world regions, having HIV/AIDS is associated with a higher likelihood of smoking cigarettes when adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and sexual risk factors. This study also supports the literature stating that cigarette smoking is inversely associated with socioeconomic status, as evidenced by higher smoking prevalence among poorer individuals, less educated individuals, and manual and agricultural laborers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,High Maternal Circulating Cotinine During Pregnancy is Associated With Persistently Shorter Stature From Birth to Five Years in an Asian Cohort,article,['sex'],"Background Self-reported maternal active smoking has been associated with reduced offspring birth length and shorter stature in early and late childhood. Objective To use circulating cotinine as an objective biomarker to investigate the association between smoking and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in pregnancy and longitudinal measures of offspring length/height from birth to 60 months. Methods In 969 maternal-offspring dyads from the GUSTO cohort, maternal plasma cotinine at 26–28 weeks’ gestation was measured by LC/MS/MS and categorized into four groups: Group 1: cotinine <0.17 ng/mL (the assay’s detection limit) and no ETS exposure; Group 2: cotinine <0.17 ng/mL but self-reported ETS; Group 3: cotinine 0.17–13.99 ng/mL (ETS or light smoking); Group 4: cotinine ≥14 ng/mL (active smoking). Results Adjusting for infant sex, gestational age at birth, ethnicity, maternal age, education, parity, BMI, and height, Group 4 offspring were shorter at birth [z-score β = −0.42 SD units (SDs) (95% CI = −0.77 to −0.06)] than Group 1 offspring. Group 4 offspring continued to be shorter at older ages, with similar effect sizes at 3 months [−0.57 SDs (−0.95 to −0.20)], 36 months [−0.53 SDs (−0.92 to −0.15)], 48 months [−0.43 SDs (−0.81 to −0.04)], and 60 months [−0.57 SDs (−0.96 to −0.17)]. Associations were particularly marked in boys. No significant differences in stature were observed in Groups 2 or 3 compared with Group 1. Conclusions This Asian longitudinal study associated high prenatal cotinine with persistently shorter stature in offspring from birth and into early childhood, whilst low prenatal cotinine levels and ETS exposure showed no such association. Implications Little is known about the long-term effects of prenatal tobacco exposure on offspring stature in Asia where passive smoking is common. This study has used an objective biomarker to reveal that the association of prenatal tobacco exposure with offspring length/height mainly occurs at a high maternal cotinine level of greater than 14 ng/mL in pregnancy, consistent with active smoking, but no significant associations were found with lower cotinine levels, consistent with passive smoking. Encouraging women to quit smoking prior to or during pregnancy may avert the long-term negative impact on their child’s height despite appreciable prenatal ETS exposure.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Exposure to Cadmium and Lead in Cigarette Smokers Who Switched to Electronic Cigarettes,article,['sex'],"Introduction Electronic cigarettes (ECs) seem to be a less harmful alternative for conventional cigarettes. This study aimed to assess whether the generated aerosols from ECs contain lower amount of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) than cigarette smoke and to detect any changes in exposure to Cd and Pb among cigarette smokers who switched completely or partially to EC. Methods EC aerosols and cigarette smoke were generated, and the determination of Cd and Pb in trapped samples and e-liquids was performed by the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry method. A cross-sectional, group-based survey was carried out using 156 volunteers classified into groups of nonsmokers, EC-only users, dual EC users-cigarette smokers, and cigarette-only smokers. Using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry, blood Cd and Pb levels were measured, and the results were compared by analysis of covariance. Results Transfer of Cd and Pb to EC aerosol was found to be minimal, although the metals were present in the remaining e-liquid from tanks used for vapor generation. The geometric mean blood Cd concentration adjusted for age and sex was 0.44 (95% confidence interval = 0.37 to 0.52) µg/L in the EC-only users, which was significantly lower than those in the smokers of 1.44 (1.16 to 1.78) and dual users of 1.38 (1.11 to 1.72). The blood Pb geometric mean differed significantly only between nonsmokers of 11.9 (10.6 to 13.3) and smokers of 15.9 (13.6 to 18.6). Conclusion The study revealed that smokers who completely switched to ECs and quit smoking conventional cigarettes may significantly reduce their exposure to Cd and probably Pb. Implications Switching to EC use is associated with a rapid and substantial decrease in the exposure to carcinogenic Cd. Exposure to Pb is probably also decreased but may be overshadowed by other factors. The study provides empirical data based not only on the analysis of generated aerosol but also on biological indicators of recent exposure—that is, the concentrations of Cd and Pb in blood, indicating EC as a potential harm-reduction device, especially regarding Cd exposure. However, in this case, dual EC use-cigarette smoking provides doubtful benefits.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Depressive Symptoms in Children: A Longitudinal Study,article,['sex'],"Introduction We investigated whether secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is associated with depressive symptoms in a population-based sample of children. Methods Never-smoking students from 29 French-language elementary schools in Greater Montréal, Canada, were followed from 5th to 11th grade (2005–2011) in five waves: 1 (5th grade), 2 (spring 6th grade), 3 (7th grade), 4 (9th grade), and 5 (11th grade). Associations between depressive symptoms and SHS exposure at home and in cars were examined in cross-sectional and longitudinal gamma generalized regression models adjusted for sex, maternal education, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Results The sample comprised 1553 baseline never-smokers (mean [SD] age = 10.7 [0.5] years; 44% male; 89% French-speaking). SHS exposure at home and in cars was associated with higher depressive symptom scores in cross-sectional analyses pooled across grades and adjusted for demographics (B [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.041 [0.017 to 0.068] for home exposure; 0.057 [0.030 to 0.084] for car exposure). In longitudinal analyses from fifth to sixth grade, B (95% CI), adjusted for demographics and baseline depressive symptoms, was 0.042 (0.003 to 0.080) for home exposure and 0.061 (0.019 to 0.103) for car exposure. From sixth to seventh grade, B (95% CI) was 0.057 (0.003 to 0.110) for home exposure and 0.074 (0.015 to 0.133) for car exposure. SHS exposure at any age did not predict depressive symptoms 2 years later. Conclusions SHS exposure is associated with depressive symptoms in young persons, both concurrently and 1 year later. This finding adds to the evidence base supporting that children should be protected from SHS exposure. Implications SHS exposure has deleterious effects on physical health and results of this study raise concerns that such exposure might also affect the mental health of young persons. Clearly, protecting children from SHS in all locations is a critical public health priority. Although research is needed to determine if the association between SHS exposure and depressive symptoms is causal, continued implementation of smoking bans and educational efforts to discourage smoking in vehicles when children are present are warranted.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Sex Differences in Subjective and Behavioral Responses to Stressful and Smoking Cues Presented in the Natural Environment of Smokers,article,['sex'],"Introduction Some evidence suggests that female smokers may show more context-dependent smoking and that males may show more stereotyped smoking (regardless of stress or cue exposure). The goal of this study was to characterize sex differences in response to stressful and smoking cues ecologically presented in daily life and variability in day-to-day smoking behavior. Methods Adult smokers (N = 177) provided ratings of mood and cigarette craving before and after stress and smoking cues were presented four times daily for 14 days via a mobile device. Linear mixed models tested whether (1) female smokers exhibited greater reactivity to stressful cues than male smokers; (2) pre-cue negative affect increased reactivity to smoking cues more in female smokers than male smokers; (3) across both sexes, greater reactivity to stressful and smoking cues correlated with greater quantity of smoking within a day; and (4) female smokers exhibited greater variability in cigarettes per day (CPD) relative to males. Results Relative to male smokers, female smokers reported greater negative affect, stress, and craving in response to stressful cues, but not smoking cues, after accounting for time since last cigarette and pre-cue responding. No sex differences in CPD or variability in CPD were detected. Days with higher subjective reactivity to cues were not associated with increased smoking, in either males or females. Conclusions Sex differences were observed in response to stress but not smoking cues in the natural environment of regular cigarette smokers. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether stress reactivity in female smokers is associated with reduced latency to smoke following stress exposure in daily life. Implications This study provides naturalistic evidence that female smokers may not be more reactive to smoking cues than males, but experience heightened stress and craving following stress exposure. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that amount smoked per day varied more for females, relative to males, as a result of more context-driven smoking for females.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Simulating the Impact of a Cigarette Minimum Floor Price Law on Adult Smoking Prevalence in California,article,['sex'],"Introduction Minimum floor price laws (MFPLs) are an emerging tobacco control policy that sets a minimum price below which a specific tobacco product cannot be sold. MFPLs target cheaper products and may disproportionately impact consumers choosing low price brands or using discounts to reduce prices. We developed a static microsimulation model for California, United States to project short-term effects of different MFPL options for a 20-stick pack of cigarettes on adult smoking behaviors. Aims and Methods We simulated 300 000 individuals defined by race and ethnicity, sex, age, and poverty status. Smoking behaviors and cigarette prices were assigned based on demographic distributions in the 2014–2016 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We drew 100 random samples (n = 30 000), weighted to state-level California demographic characteristics. We simulated six MFPL options and modeled impacts on smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption, in general, and separately for those in households below or above 250% of the federal poverty level, assuming a price elasticity of −0.4. Results Predicted changes in prices, prevalence, and consumption increased exponentially as the floor price increased from $7.00 to $9.50. Assuming 15% policy avoidance, projected increases in average cigarette prices ranged from $0.19 to $1.61. Decreases in smoking prevalence ranged from 0.05 to 0.43 percentage points, and decreases in average monthly cigarette consumption ranged from 1.4 to 12.3 cigarettes. Projected prices increased, and prevalence and consumption decreased, more among individuals in households below 250% federal poverty level. Conclusions MFPLs are a promising tobacco control strategy with the potential to reduce socioeconomic disparities in cigarette smoking prevalence and consumption. Implications Despite reductions in adult smoking prevalence, significant socioeconomic disparities remain, with lower-income groups smoking at substantially higher levels than higher-income groups. Policies that set a floor price below which a tobacco product cannot be sold could reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking, depending on variation in prices paid by smokers prepolicy. By using a microsimulation model to predict changes in smoking for different population groups in California under several floor price scenarios, this study demonstrates that MFPLs have the potential to reduce adult smoking prevalence overall, and especially for lower-income tobacco users.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Data Visualization Tools of Tobacco Product Use Patterns, Transitions and Sex Differences in the PATH Youth Data",article,['sex'],"Introduction Evaluations of multiple tobacco product use and temporal changes in patterns of use are complicated by a large number of combinations and transitions. Visualization tools could easily identify most common patterns and transitions. Methods Set intersection bar plots describe ever use of five tobacco products among 12–17 years old youth in wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (N = 11 497). Heat maps visualize unweighted frequencies of transitions from ever use at wave 1 (2013–2014) to past 12-month use at wave 2 (2014–2015). Weighted calibrated heat maps assess differences in relative frequencies of transitions by pattern at wave 1 and identify differences in transitions by sex. Results The most common tobacco product ever use patterns in wave 1 were of cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only or hookah only, followed by ever use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Initiation of use between waves was uncommon. The most frequent transition among those who reported use at wave 2 but not at wave 1 (N = 971) was to e-cigarette use (N = 301). However, among e-cigarette-only ever users at wave 1 (N = 260), about half did not report any product use at wave 2. Use of three or more products remained stable. Adolescent girls compared to boys appeared more likely to report hookah use at both waves. Conclusion Set intersection bar plots and heat maps are useful for visualizing tobacco product use patterns and transitions, especially for multiple products. Both techniques could identify common problematic tobacco use patterns across and within populations. Implications Given the growing complexity of the youth tobacco use landscape, approaches to efficiently communicate patterns of multiple tobacco product use should be used more often. This study introduces set intersection bar plots and modified versions of heat maps to the tobacco product literature and illustrates their use in the PATH youth sample. These techniques are useful for visualizing absolute and relative frequencies of multiple possible patterns and transitions. They also suggest targets for subsequent statistical inference such as sex differences in hookah use. The methods can be applied more generally for data visualization wherever large number of combinations occurs.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Impact of UK Tobacco Control Policies on Inequalities in Youth Smoking Uptake: A Natural Experiment Study,article,['sex'],"Introduction UK countries implemented smoke-free public places legislation and increased the legal age for tobacco purchase from 16 to 18 years between 2006 and 2008. We evaluated the immediate and long-term impacts of these UK policy changes on youth smoking uptake and inequalities therein. Aims and Methods We studied 74 960 person-years of longitudinal data from 14 992 youths (aged 11–15 years) in annual UK household surveys between 1994 and 2016. Discrete-time event history analyses examined whether changes in rates of youth smoking transitions (initiation, experimentation, and escalation to daily smoking or quitting) or their inequalities (by parental education) were associated with policy implementation. Parallel analyses examined smoke-free legislation and the change in legal age. We interpret the results as a combined effect of the two pieces of legislation as their implementation dates were too close to identify separate effects. Models were adjusted for sex, age, UK country, historical year, tobacco taxation, and e-cigarette prevalence, with multiple imputation for missing data. Results For both policies, smoking initiation reduced following implementation (change in legal age odds ratio [OR]: 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55 to 0.81; smoke-free legislation OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.82), while inequalities in initiation narrowed over subsequent years. The legal age change was associated with annual increases in progression from initiation to occasional smoking (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.50) and a reduction in quitting following implementation (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.94). Similar effects were observed for smoke-free legislation but CIs overlapped the null. Conclusions Policies such as these may be highly effective in preventing and reducing socioeconomic inequalities in youth smoking initiation. Implications UK implementation of smoke-free legislation and an increase in the legal age for tobacco purchase from 16 to 18 years were associated with an immediate reduction in smoking initiation and a narrowing of inequalities in initiation over subsequent years. While the policies were associated with reductions in the initiation, progression to occasional smoking increased and quitting decreased following the legislation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Social Causation, Social Selection, or Common Determinants? Examining Competing Explanations for the Link Between Young Adult Unemployment and Nicotine Dependence",article,['gender'],"Introduction Unemployment has been related to smoking, yet the causal nature of the association is subject to continued debate. Social causation argues that unemployment triggers changes in smoking, whereas the social selection hypothesis proposes that pre-existing smoking behavior lowers the probability of maintaining employment. The present study tested these competing explanations while accounting for another alternative explanation—common liability. Methods Data were from the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a longitudinal cohort followed from birth to age 35. Odds were generated for having nicotine dependence in models for social causation and being unemployed in models for social selection. These models were extended to include possible common liability factors during childhood (eg, novelty seeking) and young adulthood (eg, major depression). Results In the model testing social causation, coefficients representing the impacts of unemployment on nicotine dependence remained statistically significant and robust (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20, 2.00), even after accounting for common determinant measures. In contrast, a reverse social selection model revealed that coefficients representing the impacts of nicotine dependence on unemployment substantially attenuated and became statistically nonsignificant as childhood factors were added (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.90, 1.45). Conclusions Unemployment may serve as inroads to nicotine addiction among young adults, not the other way, even in the context of nicotine dependence, a more impaired form of smoking that may arguably hold higher potential to generate social selection processes. This social causation process cannot be completely attributable to common determinant factors. Implications It is critical to clarify whether unemployment triggers changes in smoking behaviors (ie, social causation) or vice versa (ie, social selection)—the answers to the question will lead to public health strategies with very different intervention targets to break the linkage. The current study findings favor social causation over social selection, regardless of gender, and support a needed shift in service profiles for unemployed young adults—from a narrow focus on job skills training to a more holistic approach that incorporates knowledge from addiction science in which unemployed young adults can find needed services to cope with job loss.

We explore postimplementation reactions to standardized cigarette packaging among never-smokers in Scotland, whether reactions vary in relation to permitted variations in pack structure, and whether reactions are associated with susceptibility. Aims and Methods A cross-sectional survey with 12–17-year-old never-smokers (n = 507) in Scotland, conducted November 2017–November 2018. Participants were shown one “regular” standardized cigarette pack (flip-top lid and straight-edged pack, similar to designs in Australia) and three standardized packs with varied pack structures (beveled-edges, slim pack, and shoulder box), which are permitted postimplementation in the United Kingdom. Participants rated each pack on eight five-point reaction measures (eg, attractiveness). Participants also indicated which pack, if any, they would choose. Smoking susceptibility was the outcome. Results The mean reaction scores for all four packs were mostly negative, however the shoulder box was consistently rated less negatively than the regular, slim, or beveled-edge packs. Most participants (87%) said they would not select any of the four packs, although susceptible participants were more likely to select one than nonsusceptible participants (25% vs. 7%; χ 2 = 29.70; p < .001). For all four packs, not finding them off-putting was associated with susceptibility (Adjusted Odds Ratio range: 2.73–3.69), albeit only a minority of adolescents did not find each pack off-putting. Conclusions Adolescents have negative reactions to the standardized cigarette packs implemented in the United Kingdom, albeit permitted variations in structure can reduce the extent of negativity. Most reactions to standardized packaging had no association with susceptibility. Implications We provide the first empirical evidence that adolescents find the standardized cigarette packs implemented in the United Kingdom unappealing and that most pack reactions have no association with susceptibility among never-smokers, with the exception of the minority who did not think that they would put them off smoking. This suggests that the legislation is achieving one of its primary aims, to reduce the appeal of packaging. That permitted variations in pack structure (eg, shoulder boxes) somewhat reduce negative reactions suggests that the United Kingdom, and other countries introducing similar legislation, should ensure that all aspects of pack design are fully standardized.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Tobacco Use Trajectories in Young Adults: Analyses of Predictors Across Systems Levels,article,['sex'],"Introduction Research is needed to examine trajectories of tobacco use beyond cigarette smoking, particularly during emerging middle young adulthood, and to identify distinct multilevel influences of use trajectories. Aims and Methods We examined (1) tobacco use trajectories over a 2-year period among 2592 young adult college students in a longitudinal cohort study and (2) predictors of these trajectories using variables from a socioecological framework, including intrapersonal-level factors (eg, sociodemographics, psychosocial factors [eg, adverse childhood experiences, depressive symptoms, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms], early-onset substance use), interpersonal factors (eg, social support, parental substance use), and community-level factors (eg, college type, rural vs. urban). Results About 64.5% were female and 65.0% were white. From age 18 to 26, 27%–31% of participants reported past 30-day use of any tobacco product. We identified four trajectory classes: Abstainers/Dabblers who never or infrequently used (89.2%); Adult users who began using frequently around age 20 and continued thereafter (5.9%); College Smokers who began using before 19 but ceased use around 25 (2.5%); and Teenage users who used during their teenage years but ceased use by 22 (1.9%). Multinomial regression showed that, compared to Abstainers/Dabblers, significant predictors (p < .05) of being (1) Adult users included being male, earlier onset marijuana use, attending public universities or technical colleges (vs. private universities), and living in urban areas; (2) College users included being male, earlier onset marijuana use, and parental alcohol or marijuana use; and (3) Teenage users included only earlier onset marijuana use. Conclusion Distinct prevention and intervention efforts may be needed to address the trajectories identified. Implications Among young adult college students, the largest proportion of tobacco users demonstrate the risk of continued and/or progression of tobacco use beyond college. In addition, specific factors, particularly sex, earlier onset marijuana use, parental use of alcohol and marijuana, and contextual factors such as college setting (type of school, rural vs. urban) may influence tobacco use outcomes. As such, prevention and cessation intervention strategies are needed to address multilevel influences.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Relationships Between Race, Gender, and Spot Urine Levels of Biomarkers of Tobacco Exposure Vary Based on How Creatinine Is Handled in Analyses",article,['gender'],"Introduction We illustrate the differential impact of common analysis approaches to handling urinary creatinine, a measure for urine dilution, on relationships between race, gender, and biomarkers of exposure measured in spot urine. Methods In smokers, spot urine levels of total nicotine equivalents (TNE, sum of total nicotine, total cotinine, and total 3′-hydroxycotinine) and total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) overall and per cigarette were examined. Relationships between race (African Americans [AA] n = 373, Whites n = 758) or gender (males n = 629, females n = 502) and TNE or NNAL were examined using the following approaches to handling creatinine: (1) unadjusted/unstandardized; (2) standardization; (3) adjustment as a covariate. Significance was considered at p < .05 Results Creatinine was higher in AA versus Whites (1.19 vs. 0.96 mg/mL; p < .0001) and in males versus females (1.21 vs. 0.84 mg/mL; p < .0001). Independent of how creatinine was handled, TNE was lower among AA than Whites (TNE ratios AA vs. Whites: 0.67–0.84; p’s < .05). Unadjusted TNE per cigarette was higher among AA versus Whites (ratio 1.12; p = .0411); however, the relationship flipped with standardization (ratio 0.90; p = .0360) and adjustment (ratio 0.95; p = .3165). Regarding gender, unadjusted TNE was higher among males versus females (ratio 1.13; p = .0063), but the relationship flipped with standardization (ratio 0.79; p < .0001) or adjustment (ratio 0.89; p = .0018). Unadjusted TNE per cigarette did not differ across gender (ratio 0.98; p = .6591), but lower levels were found in males versus females with standardization (ratio 0.68; p < .0001) and adjustment (ratio 0.74; p < .0001). NNAL displayed similar patterns. Conclusions Relationships between race, gender, and spot urine levels of biomarkers of exposure can vary greatly based on how creatinine is handled in analyses. Implications Lack of appropriate methods can lead to discrepancies across reports on variability of urinary biomarkers by race and gender. We recommend that for any analyses of biomarkers of exposure measure in spot urine samples across race, gender, or other population subgroups that differ in urinary creatinine levels, sensitivity analyses comparing the different methods for handling urinary creatinine should be conducted.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Panama a Small Country With a Huge Story of Success in Tobacco Control Health Policies,article,['sex'],"Panama is a tropical low middle-income country placed in the narrowest part of the Central American isthmus. According to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, Panama has the lowest recorded prevalence of tobacco consumption in the Americas in adults (6.4%) in 2013. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey report was preceded by the 2002 Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) that was applied to teens aged 13–15 years in 2002. Later on, three additional GYTS were applied in 2008, 2012, and 2017. Between 2002 and 2008, a large reduction of current tobacco use among teens was recorded (from 21.0% to 11.4% among male teens and from 10.6% to 7.4% among female teens), and data were presented in the 15th Conference of the International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases that took place in Tokyo, Japan. Few months preceding the application of GYTS in 2008, the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control was fully implemented as the law 13/2008. Several Tobacco Control Regulations (TCRs) have been implemented, based on the law 13/2008 which is the foundation of these regulations. The TCRs include a full and comprehensive ban on tobacco products advertisement, promotion and sponsorship; open and closed public smoke-free environments; tobacco product minor sales ban; 100% selective tobacco products sales tax, electronic nicotine delivery systems, and alike sales ban; and the adoption of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products. The Panamanian state has unsuccessfully been sued by Tobacco Industry in the Panamanian Supreme Court, in order to make some TCRs void and null, particularly those related to smoke-free environment and tobacco products advertisement, promotion, and sponsorship (TAPS) ban. All of these lawsuits were dismissed and we presented the cases in the 15th Conference of the International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases (ISPTID). Panamanian authorities have been quite resilient to the TI interference, because they are aware of the dangers related to tobacco product use. Despite Panama representing a very small market for tobacco products, TI unsuccessfully tries to intereference suing the Panamanian State to make TCRs null and void. The TCRs ruling in Panama represents jurisprudence for countries that are larger markets for tobacco products. After 2008, data from GYTS show a steady decline of tobacco use prevalence among teens, particularly among male teens, but it was not observed among females. According to the latest GYTS report 2017, recently released in July, the current tobacco use prevalence was 7.8% without any significant difference in sex.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz230,"Quintana, Hedley Knewjen; Roa, Reina","Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies, Panama City, Panama Tobacco Control Focal Point, Ministry of Health of Panama, Panama City, Panama"
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility and Utilization Among Transgender Patients: An Analysis of the 2017–2018 United States Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey,article,"['cisgender', 'gender', 'gender identity', 'transgender']","Introduction Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons disproportionately face many health disparities including a higher risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer screening (LCS) using low-dose chest computed tomography has reduced lung cancer mortality in eligible high-risk smokers across several large trials, yet utilization of LCS remains low. TGD persons may be less likely to receive recommended cancer screening compared with cisgender populations. We sought to compare eligibility for and utilization of LCS between TGD and cisgender persons in the United States. We also examined if the utilization of LCS varied by smoking status within each gender identity group. Methods We analyzed data from the 2017 and 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) cross-sectional survey to determine eligibility and utilization of LCS among TGD participants compared with cisgender persons. Logistical regression analysis of potentially confounding variables included age category, race/ethnicity, income, employment status, health insurance, and having a personal doctor. Results Of 37 023 weighted respondents, 0.5% were TGD. Although eligibility for LCS was statistically similar (8.8% TGD vs. 12.2% cisgender) (adjusted odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.27–2.39, p = .703), only 2.3% of TGD participants reported obtaining a LCS chest computed tomography versus 17.2% of cisgender participants (adjusted odds ratio = 0.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.01–0.59, p = .019). Smoking status showed no association with LCS utilization among gender identity groups. Conclusions TGD persons may be less likely to receive LCS despite having similar smoking status and eligibility of cisgender persons, suggesting a disparity in utilization of this preventative health service. Implications Targeted efforts to increase LCS utilization and promote smoking cessation for at-risk TGD patients may be warranted.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Correlates of Awareness and Use of Heated Tobacco Products in a Sample of US Young Adults in 2018–2019,article,['gender'],"Introduction Tobacco companies have devoted increased resources in recent years to developing and marketing heated tobacco products (HTPs) as alternatives to combustible products like cigarettes. However, little is known about correlates of awareness and use of these products in American young adults. Methods Two thousand four hundred ninety-seven young adults (mean age = 21.6) completed survey items on HTP awareness and lifetime use in 2018–2019. Logistic regression models compared young adults who were (1) unaware of HTPs (reference group) with those who were, (2) aware of HTPs, and (3) had ever used HTPs on demographic, tobacco, and other substance use characteristics. Among current smokers, these groups were compared on cigarette use, dependence, and readiness to quit. Results Approximately 12% of respondents (n = 293) were aware of HTPs, and 5% (n = 134) reported lifetime HTP use. Controlling for demographics, HTP awareness and use were both associated with greater use of all types of tobacco products, number of different tobacco products, and use of marijuana and other drugs. Among current smokers, HTP awareness and use correlated with heavier cigarette consumption, greater dependence, and past-month marijuana use, but not with recent quit attempts or thinking about quitting cigarettes. Conclusions Awareness and use of HTPs among young adults were associated with greater use of tobacco products and other substances and, among current smokers, with greater cigarette dependence (but not cessation-related factors). As these products become increasingly available in the United States, additional surveillance and monitoring activities are needed to better understand use patterns, consequences, and reasons for using HTPs. Implications Few studies have examined factors associated with awareness and use of heated tobacco products (HTPs) among US young adults. HTP awareness and lifetime use correlated with a range of factors, including male gender, white race/ethnicity, and tobacco and other substance use. Lifetime use of HTPs was low (5%); most lifetime HTP users reported history of other tobacco use, but a sizeable minority (14%) reported no other tobacco product use history. Among current cigarette smokers, cigarette dependence, poly-tobacco use, and marijuana use—but not cigarette cessation attempts or contemplation—were associated with greater likelihood of awareness and use of HTPs.

Yet, there is a critical gap in research focused on measuring SGM tobacco-related health disparities and addressing unmet needs of SGM individuals in the context of nicotine and tobacco research. Aims and Methods In this commentary, we summarize recommendations discussed during a pre-conference workshop focused on challenges and opportunities in conducting SGM tobacco control research at the 2019 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Annual Meeting. Results Specifically, we recommend defining and measuring SGM identity in all nicotine and tobacco research routinely, using novel methods to engage a demographically diverse sample of the SGM population, and eliciting SGM community voices in tobacco control research. Conclusions Addressing these critical research gaps will enable the scientific community to generate the data to fully understand and support SGM individuals in tobacco use prevention and cessation. Implications Tobacco use and its consequences have become increasingly concentrated in disadvantaged groups, including sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Through concrete recommendations in this commentary, we aimed to promote health equity, diversity, and inclusion in tobacco research for SGM populations by urging the scientific community to consider expanding efforts to monitor and address tobacco-related health disparities of SGM populations within their respective research programs.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Rewarding Effects of Nicotine in Adolescent and Adult Male and Female Rats as Measured Using Intracranial Self-stimulation,article,['sex'],"Introduction Tobacco is highly addictive, and after the development of dependence, it is difficult to quit smoking. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that play a role in the initiation of smoking. The rewarding effects of nicotine play a role in the initiation of smoking and the goal of the present study was to determine the rewarding effects of nicotine in adolescent and adult male and female rats. Methods Male and female Wistar rats were prepared with intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrodes between postnatal day (P) 23 and 33. They were then trained on the ICSS procedure and the effect of nicotine (0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg) on the reward thresholds and response latencies was investigated during adolescence (P40–59) or adulthood (>P75). Results Nicotine lowered the brain reward thresholds of the adult and adolescent male and female rats. The nicotine-induced decrease in the reward thresholds was the same in the adult male and adult female rats. However, nicotine induced a greater decrease in the reward thresholds of the adolescent female rats than the adolescent male rats. Nicotine decreased the response latencies of all groups and there was no effect of age or sex. Conclusions Nicotine enhances reward function and psychomotor performance in adolescent and adult male and female rats. Adolescent female rats are more sensitive to the acute rewarding effects of nicotine than adolescent male rats. Therefore, the rewarding effects of nicotine might play a greater role in the initiation of smoking in adolescent females than in adolescent males. Implications The great majority of people start smoking during adolescence. The present studies suggest that during this period female rats are more sensitive to the acute rewarding effects of low and intermediate doses of nicotine than male rats. The rewarding properties of nicotine play a role in the initiation of smoking and establishing habitual smoking. Therefore, the present findings might explain why adolescent females are at a higher risk for becoming nicotine dependent than adolescent males.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Impact of Menthol on Oral Nicotine Consumption in Female and Male Sprague Dawley Rats,article,['sex'],"Introduction One of the preferable flavors in oral nicotine delivery systems is menthol which masks the harshness of tobacco. However, possible interactions between oral menthol and nicotine on intake and preference remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of menthol on oral nicotine consumption. Methods Adult Sprague Dawley female and male rats (n = 8 per group) were given a choice of water or drug solution by using two-bottle free choice paradigm for 2 weeks: vehicle (5% ethanol), nicotine (20 mg/L), menthol (1 g/L) and mentholated nicotine groups. At the end of the study, plasma nicotine levels were determined. Results When rats were given a choice of nicotine or water, nicotine intake was similar between female and male rats. Menthol addition to nicotine solution significantly increased nicotine intake and preference in male but not female rats without a considerable effect on total fluid intake and body weight change in either sex. The average nicotine intake in male rats was 0.5 ± 0.05 and 1.4 ± 0.12 mg/kg/day for nicotine and menthol-nicotine combination (p < .05), respectively. The average nicotine intake in female rats was 0.6 ± 0.05 and 0.6 ± 0.03 mg/kg/day for nicotine and menthol-nicotine combination (p > .05), respectively. Plasma nicotine levels were not significantly different between the groups in either male (nicotine group: 20.8 ± 4.9, mentholated nicotine group: 31.9 ± 3.2 ng/mL) or female (nicotine group: 24.0 ± 3.3, mentholated nicotine group: 17.8 ± 2.9 ng/mL) rats (p > .05). Conclusions Menthol increases oral nicotine consumption in male, but not female, rats. Implications This study may provide data on the co-use of menthol and nicotine in smokeless tobacco, particularly oral dissolvable tobacco products.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Sex Differences in the Reward-Enhancing Effects of Nicotine on Ethanol Reinforcement: A Reinforcer Demand Analysis,article,"['biological sex', 'sex']","Background Alcohol is often consumed with tobacco, and dependence to alcohol and tobacco are highly comorbid. In addition, there are differences in the prevalence of nicotine- and alcohol-abuse between the sexes. Nicotine produces enhancing effects on the value of other reinforcers, which may extend to alcohol. Methods Male and female Wistar rats were trained to self-administer 15% ethanol solution in 30-minute sessions. Once ethanol self-administration was established, demand for ethanol was evaluated using an exponential reinforcer demand method, in which the response cost per reinforcer delivery was systematically increased over blocks of several sessions. Within each cost condition, rats were preinjected with nicotine (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg/kg base, SC) or saline 5 minutes before self-administration sessions. The effects of nicotine dose and biological sex were evaluated using the estimates generated by the reinforcer demand model. Results Under saline conditions, males showed greater sensitivity to ethanol reinforcement than females. Nicotine enhanced the reinforcement value of alcohol and this varied with sex. In both sexes, 0.4 mg/kg nicotine decreased intensity of ethanol demand. However, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg nicotine decreased elasticity of ethanol demand in females, but not in males. Conclusions Nicotine enhances ethanol reinforcement, which may partially drive comorbidity between nicotine-abuse and alcohol-abuse. Males showed signs of greater ethanol reinforcement value than females under saline conditions, and nicotine attenuated this effect by increasing ethanol reinforcement value in the females. These findings highlight that a complete understanding of alcohol-abuse must include a thorough study of alcohol use in the context of other drug use, including nicotine. Implications Nicotine dose dependently enhances the alcohol reinforcement value in a manner that is clearly influenced by biological sex. Under saline baseline conditions, males show lower elasticity of demand for alcohol reinforcement than females, indicative of greater reinforcement value. However, nicotine attenuated this difference by enhancing alcohol reward in the females. Specifically, low-to-moderate doses (0.05–0.2 mg/kg) of nicotine decreased elasticity of alcohol demand in female rats, increasing the perseverance of their alcohol taking behavior. These data indicate that the well-documented reward-enhancing effects of nicotine on sensory reinforcement extend to alcohol reinforcement and that these vary with biological sex.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Changes in Nicotine Metabolite Ratio Among Daily Smokers Receiving Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder,article,['sex'],"Introduction Alcohol may influence the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), an index of the rate of nicotine metabolism that is associated smoking level and lapses. We examined if NMR changes during alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment and how changes in NMR relate to reductions in drinking. Methods Using an observational design, 22 daily smokers [63.64% male, Mage = 46.77 (11.37)] receiving AUD treatment completed baseline and follow-up appointments 3 weeks apart. At each appointment, daily alcohol and cigarette use, salivary and urinary NMR, nicotine exposure via urinary total nicotine equivalents, and carbon monoxide were assessed. Multilevel models examined the change over time in NMR and its within-person relations with changes in drinks per week. Sex differences were evaluated. Results There were significant reductions in both salivary and urinary NMR over time for men (p = .02; p = .01, respectively) but not for women (p = .54; p = .90, respectively). There were no changes over time in total nicotine equivalents (p = .09), carbon monoxide (p = .44), or cigarette use (p = .44) in either sex. Drinks per week were significantly reduced for men (29.12 drink reduction, p < .001) but not for women (2.28 drink reduction, p = .80); however, within-person changes in drinking were not associated with changes in salivary or urinary NMR (p = .99; p = .19). Conclusions The reduction in alcohol use and NMR in men provides indirect support for alcohol increasing NMR. In contrast, the low baseline drinking and lack of alcohol reduction likely underlie the lack of change in NMR in females. Reasons for NMR reductions during AUD treatment and its effects on smoking require further study. Implications Three weeks of alcohol use disorder treatment among daily smokers coincided with a significant reduction in both alcohol use and NMR for men; however, neither drinking level nor NMR changed for women. The findings indirectly support that heavy drinking increases NMR, which is reversed with reduced drinking. Additional research is needed to establish if these changes in NMR correlate with smoking and cessation outcomes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Urine Metabolites for Estimating Daily Intake of Nicotine From Cigarette Smoking,article,['sex'],"Introduction Accurate measurement of nicotine exposure from cigarette smoke is important in studying disease risk and level of dependence. Urine total nicotine equivalents, the molar sum of nicotine and six metabolites (NE7), accounts for more than 90% of a nicotine dose and is independent of individual metabolic differences. However, measuring NE7 is technically difficult and costly. We compared NE7, the gold standard of nicotine intake, with different combinations of fewer urinary nicotine metabolites. We also examined the impact of individual differences in nicotine metabolic rate, sex, and race on strength of association with NE7. Methods Urine samples from 796 daily smokers, who participated across five clinical studies, were assayed for nicotine and/or metabolites. Associations with NE7 were assessed by regression and Bland–Altman analyses. Results Overall, the molar sum of urine [cotinine + 3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC)] (NE2) and [nicotine + cotinine + 3HC] (NE3) were strongly correlated with NE7 (r = .97 and .99, respectively). However, in slow metabolizers NE2 was less predictive of NE7, whereas NE3 was equally robust. Urine total cotinine was also strongly correlated with NE7 (r = .87). Conclusions Urine NE3 is a robust biomarker of daily nicotine intake, independently of individual metabolic differences, whereas NE2 is less accurate in slow metabolizers. Our findings inform the selection of more rigorous and cost-effective measures to assess nicotine exposure in tobacco research studies. Implications The molar sum of urine total nicotine, cotinine and 3HC (NE3) is a robust biomarker of daily nicotine intake, independently of individual metabolic differences, and performs as well as measuring seven nicotine metabolites (NE7).

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Is Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Associated With Smoking Initiation? Replication Using a Large Finnish Population Sample,article,['sex'],"Introduction Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor in the central nervous system. There is evidence for the involvement of BDNF in addictions and mental disorders. We aimed to replicate the earlier reported association of a functional genetic variant of BDNF with smoking initiation (SI) using a large population-based sample and to test whether the association is independent of depression. Methods Our sample was drawn from the Finnish population-based FINRISK surveys conducted in 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007. We had nonmissing data on the genotype BDNF  Val66Met (G/A) variant (rs6265) and self-reported never (n = 10 619) versus ever (n = 16 028) smoking among 26 647 adults aged 25–74 years. The association between BDNF  Val66Met and SI was modeled using logistic regression adjusted for age and sex, and in secondary analyses also for depression. Depression was defined as self-reported depression diagnosed or treated by physician during the past year. Results The sex- and age-adjusted analysis confirmed that the major (Val) allele increased the risk of being a lifetime ever smoker (per allele odds ratio [OR] = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.12; p = .01). When depression, which itself was significantly associated with SI (OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.37 to 1.82; p < .001), was added to the model, the association of the gene with SI remained significant (per allele OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.12; p = .01). Exclusion of depressed individuals did not change the results (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.12; p = .02). Conclusions In a Finnish population sample, we replicated the earlier reported association of BDNF Val66Met with SI. Our data further suggest that this association is independent of depression. Implications Earlier finding about the association between the BDNF gene and smoking initiation is replicated and shown to be independent of depression within Finnish adult population.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Acute Impact of Hatha Yoga on Craving Among Smokers Attempting to Reduce or Quit,article,['gender'],"Introduction Despite negative effects of smoking, smokers have difficulty quitting, suggesting a need for additional strategies to help them quit. A single-session hatha yoga intervention acutely reduced craving among nicotine-deprived smokers not attempting to reduce or quit, yet it is unknown if it reduces craving among those attempting to change their smoking. Thus, this study tested the efficacy of a single-session hatha yoga intervention for acutely reducing craving among smokers attempting to reduce or quit smoking. Methods Data presented are part of a larger dissertation project. Participants were 55 community-recruited smokers (62% male) motivated to reduce or quit smoking randomized to one session of hatha yoga (n = 25) or wellness control (ie, reading educational materials about healthy lifestyle; n = 30) on their intervention day (ie, the day on which they began to reduce or quit smoking). Participants rated, “I have a desire for a cigarette right now,” on a 7-point Likert scale immediately before and after the intervention. Results After statistically controlling for CO in breath, participant type, age, gender, race, and ethnicity, a significant Time × Condition interaction was found, F(1, 47) = 4.72, p = .035, ηp2 = .09, suggesting craving decreased at a greater rate in the hatha yoga condition relative to the wellness condition. Conclusions Results from this study add to a growing body of research demonstrating the potential clinical utility of hatha yoga as an adjunctive intervention tool for smoking cessation. Implications This is the first known study to test the impact of a single-session hatha yoga intervention on craving among adult smokers attempting to reduce or quit smoking. We found that 30 minutes of hatha yoga produced a greater reduction in craving compared to a 30-minute wellness control condition. This relationship was evident even after statistically accounting for other important variables (eg, gender). Results of this study add to a growing body of literature demonstrating the potential clinical utility of hatha yoga as an adjunctive intervention strategy for smoking cessation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Disseminating a Smoke-free Homes Program to Low Socioeconomic Status Households in the United States Through 2-1-1: Results of a National Impact Evaluation,article,['gender'],"Introduction Given homes are now a primary source of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in the United States, research-tested interventions that promote smoke-free homes should be evaluated in real-world settings to build the evidence base for dissemination. This study describes outcome evaluation results from a dissemination and implementation study of a research-tested program to increase smoke-free home rules through US 2-1-1 helplines. Methods Five 2-1-1 organizations, chosen through a competitive application process, were awarded grants of up to $70 000. 2-1-1 staff recruited participants, delivered the intervention, and evaluated the program. 2-1-1 clients who were recruited into the program allowed smoking in the home, lived in households with both a smoker and a nonsmoker or child, spoke English, and were at least 18 years old. Self-reported outcomes were assessed using a pre-post design, with follow-up at 2 months post baseline. Results A total of 2345 households (335–605 per 2-1-1 center) were enrolled by 2-1-1 staff. Most participants were female (82%) and smokers (76%), and half were African American (54%). Overall, 40.1% (n = 940) reported creating a full household smoking ban. Among the nonsmoking adults reached at follow-up (n = 389), days of SHS exposure in the past week decreased from 4.9 (SD = 2.52) to 1.2 (SD = 2.20). Among the 1148 smokers reached for follow-up, 211 people quit, an absolute reduction in smoking of 18.4% (p < .0001), with no differences by gender. Conclusions Among those reached for 2-month follow-up, the proportion who reported establishing a smoke-free home was comparable to or higher than smoke-free home rates in the prior controlled research studies. Implications Dissemination of this brief research-tested intervention via a national grants program with support from university staff to five 2-1-1 centers increased home smoking bans, decreased SHS exposure, and increased cessation rates. Although the program delivery capacity demonstrated by these competitively selected 2-1-1s may not generalize to the broader 2-1-1 network in the United States, or social service agencies outside of the United States, partnering with 2-1-1s may be a promising avenue for large-scale dissemination of this smoke-free homes program and other public health programs to low socioeconomic status populations in the United States.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Smoking Among Immigrant Groups in the United States: Prevalence, Education Gradients, and Male-to-Female Ratios",article,['male-to-female'],"Introduction Immigrants in the United States are less likely to smoke than those born in the United States, but studies have not fully described the diversity of their smoking patterns. We investigate smoking by world region of birth and duration of residence in the United States, with a comprehensive approach covering current prevalence levels, education gradients, and male-to-female ratios. Methods The data originate from the National Health Interview Surveys, 2000–2015, and the sample of 365 404 includes both US-born and foreign-born respondents aged 25–70 years. World region of birth and duration of residence in the United States measure immigrant characteristics. Current cigarette smoking was analyzed using logistic regression. Results Immigrant groups were protected from smoking and had weaker education gradients in smoking and larger male-to-female smoking ratios than the US-born population. However, large differences emerged among the immigrant groups for region of birth but less so for duration of residence in the United States. For example, immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent have low prevalence, weak education gradients, and high male-to-female ratios. Immigrants from Europe have the opposite pattern, and immigrants from Latin America fall between those two extremes. Conclusion The stage of the cigarette epidemic in the region of birth helps explain the diverse group profiles. Duration of residence in the United States does less to account for the differences in smoking than region of birth. The findings illustrate the heterogeneity of immigrant populations originating from diverse regions across the world and limited convergence with the host population after immigration. Implications The study identifies immigrant groups that, because of high smoking prevalence related to levels in the host country, should be targeted for cessation efforts. It also identifies immigrant groups with low prevalence for which anti-smoking programs should encourage maintenance of healthy habits. Many immigrant groups show strong education disparities in smoking, further suggesting that smokers with lower levels of education be targeted by public health programs.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Procedure to Standardize Puff Topography During Evaluations of Acute Tobacco or Electronic Cigarette Exposure,article,['sex'],"Introduction Documenting factors that influence differential sensitivity to acutely inhaled nicotine products requires carefully controlling the amount of exposure (dose), and thus a procedure by which to control such exposure. Methods We evaluated consistency of puff volume from intermittent acute exposures to smoked tobacco cigarettes (study 1, n = 45, plus a comparison study of uninstructed use with n = 59) and to vaped electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes; study 2, n = 27 naive to e-cigarettes) in adult-dependent smokers. All in primary studies 1 and 2 participated in research administering different nicotine levels in each product under blind conditions, one per session using within-subject designs. In both studies, participants followed an automated instructional procedure on a computer monitor standardizing the timing and amount of exposure to each product during a given trial, with four trials per session, each separated by 20 minutes. Puff volume per trial via Clinical Research Support System (CReSS) was the primary dependent measure to determine consistency across trials via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results Control over topography with both inhaled products was demonstrated by highly significant ICCs for puff volume across trials. Instructed control with own brand was generally better in study 1 than with uninstructed smoking in the comparison sample, as expected. As intended, reliability of puff volume generally did not differ by menthol preference or sex in either study, but ICCs in study 2 tended to be lower for some men using the placebo e-cigarette. Conclusions This instructional procedure may substantially improve control over amounts of acute exposure to tobacco or e-cigarette use. Implications Control over topography in studies of acute exposure to these inhaled products can potentially aid validity of research into differential sensitivity to use, so findings can be attributed to factors of interest and not to variable exposure. Our procedure minimized variability in exposure to the same product and between moderate nicotine products, but remaining differences suggest that compensation for very low or no nicotine commercial products may be difficult to totally eliminate with these instructions alone. Further study is needed to determine this procedure’s utility with other inhaled products among experienced users and when comparing different products in between-groups analyses.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Awareness of Changes in E-cigarette Regulations and Behavior Before and After Implementation: A Longitudinal Survey of Smokers, Ex-smokers, and Vapers in the United Kingdom",article,['gender'],"Introduction In line with the European Union’s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), new regulations for electronic cigarettes implemented in the United Kingdom between May 2016 and May 2017 included limiting refills to 10 mL, tank and cartridge sizes to 2 mL, and nicotine concentrations to 20 mg/mL. Aims To investigate the (1) awareness of new regulations, (2) product use before and after implementation, and (3) association between use of compliant products and subsequent smoking. Methods A UK online longitudinal survey of smokers, ex-smokers, and vapers was conducted between May and June 2016 (wave 4) and September 2017 (wave 5).The following methods were used: (1) to assess awareness of changes, proportions were calculated by smoking and vaping status (n = 1606). (2) Comparison of refill volume, tank and cartridge volumes, nicotine concentration at waves 4 and 5 (n = 199–388) was conducted. (3) Association was studied between number of TPD-compliant products used at wave 4 and smoking at wave 5, adjusted for wave 4 vaping status, age, gender, income, urges to smoke, and device type (n = 480). Results Awareness of regulations was highest for refill volume (10.1%; 37.4% among exclusive vapers) and nicotine concentration (9.5%; 27.3%). Higher proportions used TPD-compliant refill volumes (60.0%–73.7%, χ2(1) = 10.9, p = .001) and nicotine concentrations (89.2%–93.9%, χ2(1) = 7.41, p = .007) in wave 5 than wave 4, with little change for tank or cartridge volumes (77.1–75.5%, χ2(1) = 0.38, p = .540). The likelihood of smoking was similar for those using no or one TPD-compliant products as it was for those using two (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.47–2.59) or three (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.69–3.55). Conclusion Several months after full implementation, awareness of new regulations was low and most vapers used TPD-compliant products. Use of compliant products was not associated with subsequent smoking. Implications Using a longitudinal survey at the beginning and a few months after the end of the transition period for implementation of new regulation on electronic cigarettes, this is the first study to assess awareness of regulation and use of compliant products. After full implementation, awareness of changes was low overall (smokers, ex-smokers, and vapers combined) although higher among those who vaped. Nevertheless, most vapers (74%–94%) used products that were compliant with the new regulations and the use of products compliant with incoming regulations did not predict whether they were smoking cigarettes after implementation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Use of JUUL E-cigarettes Among Youth in the United States,article,['sex'],"Introduction JUUL has emerged as the leading brand in a rapidly evolving electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) market. JUUL is distinctive for its novel nicotine delivery method that results in high nicotine concentrations, as well as its sleek, discreet design. This study examined national estimates of JUUL among youth in the United States, including whether JUUL users report different patterns of use compared to users of other e-cigarettes. Methods Data were analyzed from the US arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (ITC) Youth Tobacco and E-cigarette Survey, an online survey conducted in July–August 2017 with youth aged 16–19 years recruited from consumer panels (n = 4086). Results Overall, 14.2% of respondents had used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days. JUUL was the second-most popular brand reported by past-30-day e-cigarette users (9.7%). Compared to e-cigarette users of other brands, JUUL users were significantly older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.56 to 4.01) and reported a greater number of computers in the household (a socioeconomic status proxy; aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.22 to 1.96), with no differences by sex, race/ethnicity, or student status. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, JUUL users were more likely than other e-cigarette users to have ever tried to quit e-cigarettes (aOR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.12 to 6.30), with no differences observed by smoking status, frequency of e-cigarette use, urges to use e-cigarettes, or perceived addiction to e-cigarettes. Conclusions JUUL was among the most popular e-cigarette brands among youth, and there were few differences in sociodemographic profile or patterns of use between users of JUUL and other e-cigarette brands. Implications This study examined national estimates of JUUL e-cigarette use among youth in the United States, during the early phase of JUUL’s popularity. JUUL was among the most popular e-cigarette brands among youth, and there were few differences in sociodemographic profile or patterns of use between JUUL and other e-cigarette brands. The findings help to characterize the rapid rise of this new product category within the rapidly evolving e-cigarette market at a time when the US Food and Drug Administration and public health community are seeking to understand JUUL and its appeal among young people.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Querying About the Use of Specific E-Cigarette Devices May Enhance Accurate Measurement of E-Cigarette Prevalence Rates Among High School Students,article,['sex'],"Introduction Prevalence estimates of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use may underestimate actual use in youth. Confusion resulting from the fact that a multitude of devices (eg, vape pens, JUULs) fall under the umbrella term “e-cigarettes,” the use of different names to refer to e-cigarettes (eg, vapes, electronic vaping devices), and the use of different terminology to refer to e-cigarette use (eg, “vaping,” “JUULing”), may lead some young e-cigarette users to incorrectly indicate nonuse. Therefore, we compared rates of endorsing lifetime e-cigarette use when adolescents were asked about lifetime e-cigarette use in two different ways. Methods In May to June 2018, a total of 1960 students from two high schools in Connecticut completed a computerized, school-based survey. Participants first reported on lifetime “e-cigarette” use and, subsequently, on lifetime use of five different e-cigarette devices: disposables, cig-a-likes, or E-hookahs; vape pens or Egos; JUULs; pod systems other than JUULs such as PHIX or Suorin; and advanced personal vaporizers or mods. Results In total, 35.8% of students endorsed lifetime “e-cigarette” use, whereas 51.3% endorsed lifetime use of at least one e-cigarette device. The kappa statistic indicated only 66.6% agreement between the methods of assessing e-cigarette use. Overall, 31.5% of adolescents who endorsed lifetime device use did not endorse lifetime “e-cigarette” use, although rates of discordant responding varied across subgroups of interest (eg, sex, race). Conclusions Assessing adolescents’ use of specific e-cigarette devices likely yields more accurate results than assessing the use of “e-cigarettes.” If these findings are replicated in a nationally representative sample, regulatory efforts requiring all e-cigarette devices to be clearly labeled as “e-cigarettes” may help to reduce confusion. Implications Different prevalence estimates of lifetime e-cigarette use were obtained depending on the way that prevalence was assessed. Specifically, fewer adolescents (35.8%) endorsed lifetime e-cigarette use when they were asked “Have you ever tried an e-cigarette, even one or two puffs?” than when they were queried about lifetime use of five different e-cigarette devices (51.3%). Among those who endorsed lifetime use of at least one specific e-cigarette device, 31.5% did not endorse lifetime “e-cigarette” use. These findings suggest that when assessing adolescents’ lifetime e-cigarette use, using of terms referring to specific devices likely produces more accurate prevalence estimates than using the term “e-cigarettes.” ",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/nty240,"Morean, Meghan E; Camenga, Deepa R; Bold, Krysten W; Kong, Grace; Jackson, Asti; Simon, Patricia; Cavallo, Dana A; Krishnan-Sarin, Suchitra","Department of Psychology, Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT"
Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,E-Cigarette Use Is Associated With Intentions to Lose Weight Among High School Students,article,['sex'],"Introduction Recent literature has demonstrated individuals may be using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as a method of weight loss and/or management. Furthermore, e-cigarette companies are developing and patenting technologies related to e-cigarettes and weight loss. This study aims to determine the association between intentions to lose weight and e-cigarette use behaviors among a nationally representative sample of high school students. Methods Data were obtained from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance survey. Participants were 12 847 students in grades 9–12 in the United States. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression models assessed the association between past 30-day e-cigarette use and weight loss intentions among 9–12 grade students. Subsample analyses were conducted, stratified by sex. Covariates included perceived weight, sex, race/ethnicity, grade, and past 30-day tobacco use. Results Overall, 23.7% of the sample used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. E-cigarette use was associated with 1.38 (95% CI = 1.07% to 1.78%) greater risk of intentions to lose weight among the full sample, controlling for covariates. Among girls, e-cigarette use was associated with 1.44 (95% CI = 1.05% to 1.97%) greater risk of intentions to lose weight, controlling for covariates. Among boys, e-cigarette use was associated with 1.40 (95% CI = 1.04% to 1.88%) greater odds of intentions to gain weight, controlling for covariates. Conclusion Findings show a significant association between e-cigarette use and intentions to lose weight among high school students, among the full sample. Interestingly, e-cigarette use was statistically associated with intentions to gain weight among boys. Longitudinal study is needed to further examine this relationship. Implications and Contribution This is the one of the first studies reporting on e-cigarette use and weight loss intentions among adolescents, both highly prevalent among this population. These findings are an important development in the study of e-cigarette use given the established link between conventional cigarette smoking and weight loss and/or management.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Smoking Across the Menopausal Transition in a 10-Year Longitudinal Sample: The Role of Sex Hormones and Depressive Symptoms,article,['sex'],"Introduction Current cigarette smoking rates among older women remain problematic, especially given that this population experiences increased smoking-related health consequences. Despite these increased health concerns, little research to date has explored smoking patterns across the menopausal transition (pre-, early-peri-, late-peri-, and postmenopausal) or the effect of unique factors such as sex hormones and depression during this transition. Methods This study used 10 yearly waves of data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation, a longitudinal dataset. Data included 1397 women endorsing ever smoking regularly at baseline. Random-effects logistic regression models were used to examine smoking transitions. Results Although there were no associations between menopausal transition stage and smoking behavior, increased estradiol was associated with an increased likelihood of quitting regular smoking (eg, transitioning from regular smoking to non-regular or no smoking; odds ratio [OR] = 1.28), whereas increased testosterone was associated with an increased likelihood of relapsing to regular smoking (eg, transitioning from former or nonregular smoking to regular smoking OR = 2.56). Depression was associated with increased likelihood of continued smoking (OR = 0.97) and relapse (OR = 1.03). Conclusions The results emphasize the need to develop interventions to target initiated or continued smoking among women across the menopausal transition and specifically highlight the importance of developing treatments that target depressive symptoms in this population. In addition, although singular hormone measures were associated with smoking behavior, there is a need for future study of dynamic changes in hormones, as well as the impact of progesterone on smoking behaviors across the menopausal transition. Implications To date, no studies have examined smoking behaviors across the menopausal transition. In this study, although menopausal transition status was not significantly related to transitions in smoking behavior, important relationships between sex hormones and depression were observed. Increased estradiol was associated with an increased likelihood of quitting regular smoking, whereas increased testosterone was associated with an increased likelihood of relapsing to regular smoking behavior. Higher depression scores were related to continued smoking and relapse to regular smoking behavior. These results highlight the need to develop interventions to target smoking cessation among women across the menopausal transition.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Potential Moderating Effects of Sex/Gender on the Acute Relative Reinforcing and Subjective Effects of Reduced Nicotine Content Cigarettes in Vulnerable Populations,article,"['gender', 'sex']","Introduction Reports in relatively healthy smokers suggest men are more sensitive than women to the subjective effects of reduced nicotine content cigarettes (RNCCs). We know of no reports examining sex differences in the relative reinforcing effects of RNCCs, an important outcome in assessing smoking’s addiction potential. The aim of the present study is to address this gap by examining sex/gender differences on reinforcing effects while examining whether sex differences in subjective effects are discernible in vulnerable populations. Methods Secondary analysis of a within-subject, double-blinded experiment examining acute effects of cigarettes varying in nicotine content (0.4, 2.4, 5.2, 15.8 mg/g) among 169 adult smokers with psychiatric conditions or socioeconomic disadvantage. Effects of dose, sex, and their interaction were examined on reinforcing (concurrent-choice and Cigarette Purchase Task [CPT] testing), and subjective effects (Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire [CEQ] and craving/withdrawal ratings). Results Reducing nicotine content decreased the relative reinforcing effects of smoking in concurrent-choice and CPT testing (p’s < .05) with no significant effects of sex nor dose × sex/gender interactions. Reducing nicotine content decreased CEQ ratings with only a single significant effect of sex (higher Psychological Reward scores among women than men, p = .02) and no significant dose × sex/gender interactions. Results on craving/withdrawal paralleled those on the CEQ. Conclusions Reducing nicotine content decreases the addiction potential of smoking independent of sex in populations highly vulnerable to smoking and addiction, with no indication that women are less sensitive to subjective effects of RNCCs or would benefit less from a policy reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes. Implications A policy reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes has the potential to reduce the addiction potential of smoking across men and women who are especially vulnerable to smoking, addiction, and tobacco-related adverse health impacts.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Evaluation of Sex Differences in the Elasticity of Demand for Nicotine and Food in Rats,article,['sex'],"Introduction Animal studies can inform policy regarding nicotine levels in tobacco products and e-cigarette solutions. Increasing the price of nicotine-containing products decreases their use, but it is unknown how the relationship between price and consumption is affected by both sex and nicotine dose. Methods A behavioral economics procedure was used to determine the demand elasticity for nicotine in male and female rats. Demand elasticity describes the relationship between price and consumption. A high level of elasticity indicates that consumption is relatively sensitive to increases in price. The rats self-administered a low dose (0.01 mg/kg/inf) or a standard dose (0.03 mg/kg/inf) of nicotine for 9 days under a fixed-ratio (FR) 1 schedule. Then the price (FR schedule) of nicotine was increased, and a demand analysis was conducted. A similar study was conducted with palatable food pellets. Results There were no sex differences in nicotine or food intake under the FR1 schedule. However, demand for 0.03 mg/kg/inf of nicotine was more elastic in females than males. Demand for 0.01 mg/kg/inf of nicotine and food was more elastic in males than females. Conclusions These findings indicate that there are no differences in nicotine and food intake between males and females when the price is low. When the price of nicotine or food is increased, males maintain their old level of intake longer than females when they have access to a standard dose of nicotine, and females maintain their intake longer when they have access to a low dose of nicotine or food. Implications This behavioral economics analysis indicates that there is no sex difference in nicotine intake when the price of nicotine is low. Increasing the price of nicotine decreases nicotine intake in a dose- and sex-specific manner. Males maintain their old level of intake longer when they have access to a standard dose of nicotine and females when they have access to a low dose. This has implications for tobacco regulatory policy. In a regulatory environment where only low nicotine-containing products are allowed, increasing the price of nicotine products may lead to a greater decrease in nicotine use in males than females.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Cigarette Smoking Is Associated With Lower Quadriceps Cross-sectional Area and Attenuation in Older Adults,article,['sex'],"Introduction In addition to well-established links with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cigarette smoking may affect skeletal muscle; however, associations with quadriceps atrophy, density, and function are unknown. This study explored the associations of current and former smoking with quadriceps muscle area and attenuation as well as muscle force (assessed as knee extension peak torque) and rate of torque development—a measure of muscle power in older adults. Methods Data from 4469 older adults, aged 66–95 years at baseline in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study with measurements of thigh computed tomography, isometric knee extension testing, self-reported smoking history, and potential covariates were analyzed. Results Sex differences were observed in these data; therefore, our final analyses are stratified by sex. In men, both former smokers and current smokers had lower muscle area (with β= –0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = –0.17 to –0.03 and β = –0.19, 95% CI = –0.33 to –0.05, respectively) and lower muscle attenuation (ie, higher fat infiltration, β = –0.08, 95% CI = –0.16 to –0.01 and β = –0.17, 95% CI = –0.34 to –0.01, respectively) when compared with never smokers. Smoking status was not associated with male peak torque or rate of torque development. In women, current smoking was associated with lower muscle attenuation (β = –0.24, 95% CI = –0.34 to –0.13) compared to never smoking. Among female smokers (current and former), muscle attenuation and peak torque were lower with increasing pack-years. Conclusions Results suggest that cigarette smoking is related to multiple muscle properties at older age and that these relationships may be different among men and women. Implications This article presents novel data, as it examined for the first time the relationship between smoking and computed tomography-derived quadriceps muscle size (cross-sectional area) and attenuation. This study suggests that current cigarette smoking is related to higher muscle fat infiltration, which may have significant health implications for the older population, because of its known association with poor physical function, falls, and hip fractures.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Smokers’ Perceptions of Cigarette Packaging With Audio Warning Messages: A Focus Group Study in Scotland,article,['gender'],"Aims The use of audio pack cues or messages is a recent trend in packaging design. There is scope to use audio technology to communicate health and cessation messages via cigarette packaging. We explored how smokers responded to cigarette packs which played audio health messages. Methods Twenty focus groups were conducted in Scotland in 2015 with smokers (n = 120) segmented by age (16–17, 18–24, 25–35, 36–50, >50), gender and social grade. Perceptions of cigarette packs which played audio warnings were explored, with four messages used: (1) a cessation message with a quitline number, (2) mortality message, (3) fertility message, and (4) message about ageing skin. Results Audio warnings were thought to increase message impact, particularly among younger smokers, as they would be hard to ignore or avoid, and repetition may lead to the messages being memorized. The warnings were considered annoying or embarrassing, and participants suggested they may discard the packs and use alternative storage. Some participants suggested that the audio warnings were off-putting and may alter their smoking behavior, with the mortality message deemed most effective and was considered relatable and felt personal. Older smokers were least likely to believe that audio warnings would affect their smoking behavior, although some thought that they may enhance cessation attempts among smokers seeking to quit, and could deter new or potential smokers, for example, young people. Conclusions Cigarette packs with audio messaging may have a role to play, now or in the future, as a novel way of communicating health and cessation information. Implications There is a lack of research exploring smokers’ perceptions of cigarette packs which play audio health messages. This focus group study provides an understanding of smokers’ immediate responses to cigarette packs which played a short health message when opened. Smokers generally viewed them as annoying or embarrassing, and some suggested the use of alternative storage. Audio warnings were thought to increase message salience, memorability, and impact, for younger smokers in particular, and some suggested that they be off-putting for themselves or others.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Flavored Tobacco Product Use and Its Association With Indicators of Tobacco Dependence Among US Adults, 2014–2015",article,['sex'],"Introduction Widely marketed flavored tobacco products might appeal to nonusers and could be contributing to recent increases in tobacco product use. We assessed flavored product use among current tobacco users; and measured associations between flavored product use and dependence among US adults. Methods Data were from the 2014–2015 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, a cross-sectional household-based survey of US adults ≥18 years (n = 163 920). Current users of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were asked whether their usual product was menthol or came in any characterizing flavors. Proportions of flavored product users were computed nationally and by state and demographic characteristics. Tobacco dependence was assessed with two proxy measures: daily use and use ≤30 minutes after waking. Associations between flavored product use and tobacco dependence were examined using logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and multi tobacco product use. Results An estimated 41.0% of current users of any tobacco product usually used a flavored product during 2014–2015. The proportion ranged from 22.5% (Maine) to 62.1% (District of Columbia). By product, the proportion ranged from 28.3% (cigars) to 87.2% (hookah). Flavored product use was associated with: daily tobacco product use among current e-cigarette users (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.71), cigar smokers (AOR = 1.42), and cigarette smokers (AOR = 1.13); and tobacco product use ≤30 minutes after waking among current cigar smokers (AOR = 1.80), and cigarette smokers (AOR = 1.11). Conclusions Restricting sales of flavored tobacco products and implementation of proven population-level tobacco control interventions could help reduce tobacco product use among US adults. Implications During 2014–2015, flavored tobacco products were widely used by US adults with variations across states and demographic characteristics. Use of flavored e-cigarettes, flavored cigars, and menthol cigarettes were associated with daily tobacco use: use of flavored cigars and menthol cigarettes were associated with tobacco use within 30 minutes after waking. These findings suggest associations between flavor use and increased tobacco dependence. Prohibiting sale of flavored products can reduce access to those products, and could help reduce tobacco dependence and promote cessation behaviors among current tobacco product users.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Opioid Use and Rate of Nicotine Metabolism Among Pregnant Smokers,article,['trans'],"Introduction Smokers who use opioids smoke more cigarettes per day (CPD) than non-opioid users, which could be due to the effects of opioids on nicotine metabolism. Moreover, nicotine metabolism increases during pregnancy, potentially making quitting more difficult for pregnant smokers. We examined nicotine metabolism and its association with opioid use (OU) and CPD in pregnant smokers. Methods We recruited pregnant women who smoked at least 5 CPD for a clinical trial of smoking cessation. Plasma nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC)/cotinine)—a biomarker of nicotine metabolism—OU (involving methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, or tramadol), and CPD were assessed at baseline. We used linear regression to examine the associations between log-transformed NMR, OU, and CPD, adjusting for race/ethnicity and menthol smoking. Results Among 129 pregnant smokers, 25 (19%) were opioid users; most were maintained on methadone (n = 14). Compared to non-OU smokers, OU smokers had higher median CPD (10.0 vs. 7.0, p = .0007), serum 3HC (81.0 vs. 42.0 ng/mL, p = .0001), and NMR (0.63 vs. 0.43, p < .0001). In addition, methadone-maintained smokers had a higher median NMR than non-OU smokers (0.66 vs. 0.43, p = .0004). Adjusting for covariates, log-transformed NMR was greater in OU smokers (p = .012), specifically methadone-maintained smokers (p = .024), than non-OU smokers. Conclusions Our preliminary results show that OU is associated with a higher NMR in pregnant smokers. A larger study sample is needed to replicate this finding, examine potential mechanisms, and determine its clinical significance. Implications Among pregnant smokers, we observed that nicotine metabolism was significantly faster among opioid users—the majority of whom were on methadone maintenance—compared to nonusers, which could have implications for smoking cessation. Further studies are needed to replicate this finding, evaluate potential mechanisms, and determine its clinical significance.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Similarities and Differences Between Sexes and Countries in the Mortality Imprint of the Smoking Epidemic in 34 Low-Mortality Countries, 1950–2014",article,['sex'],"Introduction The smoking epidemic greatly affected mortality levels and trends, especially among men in low-mortality countries. The objective of this article was to examine similarities and differences between sexes and low-mortality countries in the mortality imprint of the smoking epidemic. This will provide important additions to the smoking epidemic model, but also improve our understanding of the differential impact of the smoking epidemic, and provide insights into its future impact. Methods Using lung-cancer mortality data for 30 European and four North American or Australasian countries, smoking-attributable mortality fractions (SAMF) by sex, age (35–99), and year (1950–2014) were indirectly estimated. The timing and level of the peak in SAMF35-99, estimated using weighting and smoothing, were compared. Results Among men in all countries except Bulgaria, a clear wave pattern was observed, with SAMF35-99 peaking, on average, at 33.4% in 1986. Eastern European men experienced the highest (40%) and Swedish men the lowest (16%) peak. Among women, SAMF35-99 peaked, on average, at 18.1% in 2007 in the North American/Australasian countries and five Northwestern European countries, and increased, on average, to 7.5% in 2014 in the remaining countries (4% in Southern and Eastern Europe). The average sex difference in the peak is at least 25.6 years in its timing and at most 22.9 percentage points in its level. Conclusions Although the progression of smoking-attributable mortality in low-mortality countries was similar, there are important unexpected sex and country differences in the maximum mortality impact of the smoking epidemic driven by cross-country differences in economic, political, and emancipatory progress. Implications The formal, systematic, and comprehensive analysis of similarities and differences between sexes and 34 low-mortality countries in long-term time trends (1950–2014) in smoking-attributable mortality provided important additions to the Global Burden of Disease study and the descriptive smoking epidemic model (Lopez et al.). Despite a general increase followed by a decline, the timing of the maximum mortality impact differs more between sexes than previously anticipated, but less between regions. The maximum mortality impact among men differs considerably between countries. The observed substantial diversity warrants country-specific tobacco control interventions and increased attention to the current or expected higher smoking-attributable mortality shares among women compared to men.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Associations Between Nicotine Metabolite Ratio and Gender With Transitions in Cigarette Smoking Status and E-Cigarette Use: Findings Across Waves 1 and 2 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study,article,"['gender', 'trans']","Introduction Nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), the ratio of trans 3′-hydroxycotinine to cotinine, is a biomarker of nicotine metabolism. Discrepant findings among clinical trials and population-based studies warrant replication on whether higher NMR, or faster nicotine metabolism, is associated with quitting cigarette smoking. Associations of NMR and e-cigarette use are largely unknown, as well as the relationship between NMR and gender on quitting cigarette smoking or e-cigarette use. Methods The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study is a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort study assessing tobacco use in the US population. In the current study, the PATH (waves 1 and 2; adult interviews) was used to evaluate longitudinal predictions in relationships among NMR and gender and their association with transitions (quit vs. current stable) in cigarette smoking status and e-cigarette use status across waves 1 and 2 of the PATH study. Results NMR and gender were not significantly associated with quit behavior for combustible cigarettes. Regarding e-cigarettes, a significant two-way interaction demonstrated that women with higher NMR were less likely to quit e-cigarette use compared to women with lower NMR (odds ratio [OR] = 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02–0.57; p = .01). Conclusions Findings identify that women with faster nicotine metabolism were 10 times less likely to quit e-cigarettes compared to women with slower nicotine metabolism across waves 1 and 2 of the PATH study. Results suggest that NMR may be used as a biomarker for transitions in e-cigarette quit behavior for women. Implications Findings identify that women with faster nicotine metabolism were 10 times less likely to quit e-cigarettes compared to women with slower nicotine metabolism. Results suggest that NMR may be used as a biomarker for transitions in e-cigarette quit behavior for women. Establishing parameters for NMR collection and for the use of NMR as a biomarker for cigarette smoking behavior and e-cigarette use is an important next step, and may have implications for early intervention and treatment for cessation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Association of Tobacco Use and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke With Suicide Attempts Among Adolescents: Findings From 33 Countries,article,['gender'],"Introduction There is evidence to suggest that tobacco use is associated with suicide attempts. However, it is unclear whether such an association can be extended to include secondhand smoke exposure. Using nationally representative data of school-attending adolescents from 33 countries, we examined the association of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke with suicide attempts. Methods We used data from the Global School–based Student Health Survey, a cross-sectional survey conducted among adolescents 12–15 years of age. We used logistic regression to estimate the country-specific associations. We then conducted random effect meta-analyses to obtain overall and country-income level pooled estimates. Lastly, we used logistic regression analyses to investigate a dose–response association of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke with suicide attempts. Results A positive association between tobacco use and suicide attempts among adolescents was present regardless of country-income level (low income: odds ratio 4.98, 95% CI: 3.11–7.96; lower middle income: 3.47, 2.91–4.15; upper middle income: 3.09, 2.75–3.47; and high income: 3.18, 2.63–3.84) and gender (boys: 3.28, 2.86–3.76; girls: 3.86, 3.30–4.51). Exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with suicide attempts, albeit weakly, among girls only (1.26, 1.14–1.39; boys: 1.00, 0.87–1.15). There was some evidence that a dose–response association of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke with suicide attempts may only exist among girls. Conclusions Adolescents who use tobacco, and adolescent girls exposed to secondhand smoke were found to be more likely to attempt suicide; however, future longitudinal studies are warranted to assess causality. Implications Our findings indicate that routine screening of adolescents for tobacco use should be implemented globally, especially when assessing suicidal behaviors and risk. Future longitudinal and intervention studies are warranted to assess causality and whether prevention efforts such as tobacco control interventions and programmes targeting tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke among adolescents could ultimately lead to a reduction in the occurrence of suicide attempts.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Effect of a 30-Min Water-Pipe Smoking Session on Cognitive Measures and Cardio-Pulmonary Parameters,article,['sex'],"Introduction One session of water-pipe tobacco smoking (WPS) can increase carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) to levels comparable to those reported in carbon monoxide poisoning, which may cause memory impairment and confusion. Methods A prospective study evaluating healthy volunteers pre- and post-30 min of WPS session. Primary outcome parameters were executive cognitive measures [digit span test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)]. The effect of repeated cognitive testing 30 min apart without WPS was evaluated in age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Secondary outcome parameters included cardio-pulmonary, COHb, serum nicotine, and cytokine changes. Results Thirty-five subjects aged 25.6 ± 4.5 years smoked water-pipe for a 30-min session. Control group included 20 subjects aged 25.2 ± 5.1 years. Digit span test median score decreased after WPS (16 and 15, respectively, p = .003), insignificant decrease in controls. Median PASAT score increased after WPS (49 and 52, respectively, p = .009); however, a much larger significant increase was observed in controls (p ≤ .001). One WPS session resulted in significant increases in heart and respiratory rates and significant decrease in FEF25–75%. Post WPS, median COHb levels increased (from 2.2% to 10.7%, p < .0001) as did median serum nicotine levels (from 1.2 to 26.8 ng/mL, p < .0001). Serum cytokines levels: IL-2 and IL-6 increased (p < .0001 for each), and IL-10 and IL-5 decreased (p < .0001 and p = .04, respectively). Conclusions One session of WPS resulted in significant negative effects on cognitive executive measures, significant increases in COHb and serum nicotine levels, and significant changes in serum cytokines. Our findings call for increasing awareness towards the possible consequences of cognitive alterations following a 30-min session of WPS. Implications One 30-min session of water-pipe smoking resulted in negative effects on executive cognitive measures, increased carboxyhemoglobin and serum nicotine, and significant changes in serum cytokine levels. This study adds to the accumulating evidence on the harmful effects of water-pipe smoking, a growing epidemic, and calls for awareness of its possible consequences of acute cognitive alterations.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Adolescent Cannabinoid and Nicotine Exposure Differentially Alters Adult Nicotine Self-Administration in Males and Females,article,['sex'],"Introduction During adolescence, exposure to nicotine or cannabis independently induces effects on neuromaturation and later cognitive function. However, the potential effect of both drugs under co-use conditions has become of increasing concern given the prevalence of e-cigarettes, legalization of cannabis, and availability of synthetic “spice” cannabinoid agonists. Aims and Methods The current studies investigated the effects of exposure to a cannabinoid receptor agonist (WIN55,212-2) and/or nicotine over a discrete time period in mid-adolescence on later intravenous nicotine self-administration in adult male and female mice. We further examined whether cannabinoid agonist administration in adulthood would alter nicotine reinforcement, with either acute or chronic pairing across 7 days. Results We found that adult males exhibited increased nicotine self-administration at a lower, rewarding nicotine dose following adolescent cannabinoid exposure, either alone or with nicotine coadministration. In contrast, adult females demonstrated an opposing effect in which adolescent cannabinoid and nicotine coexposure resulted in decreased nicotine intake compared with the nicotine only and control groups. Furthermore, after maintaining nicotine self-administration across sessions, pretreatment with a low dose of the cannabinoid agonist decreased nicotine intake in both male and female control mice, and this lowering effect was evidenced after both acute and chronic treatment. However, the cannabinoid agonist was ineffective in altering nicotine intake in mice previously exposed to nicotine, cannabinoid agonist, or both during adolescence. Conclusions These data provide evidence that adolescent drug exposure can alter later nicotine reinforcement in a sex-specific manner and can further modulate the effectiveness of interventions in reducing nicotine intake during adulthood. Implications These studies demonstrate a significant impact of nicotine, cannabinoids, or coexposure on developmental processes during adolescence. Differential effects were observed within each sex, with opposing results found for cannabinoid exposure on nicotine intake in males and females. Intriguingly, we also evidenced resistance to the lowering effects of a cannabinoid agonist on nicotine intake in adulthood based on adolescent drug exposure. Thus, these findings have important implications for our understanding of the impact of nicotine and cannabinoids (eg, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and synthetic “spice” cannabinoids) during development, with further implications for the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions based on prior drug exposure in youth.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Models for Analyzing Zero-Inflated and Overdispersed Count Data: An Application to Cigarette and Marijuana Use,article,['gender'],"Introduction This article describes different methods for analyzing counts and illustrates their use on cigarette and marijuana smoking data. Methods The Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), hurdle Poisson (HUP), negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), and hurdle negative binomial (HUNB) regression models are considered. The different approaches are evaluated in terms of the ability to take into account zero-inflation (extra zeroes) and overdispersion (variance larger than expected) in count outcomes, with emphasis placed on model fit, interpretation, and choosing an appropriate model given the nature of the data. The illustrative data example focuses on cigarette and marijuana smoking reports from a study on smoking habits among youth e-cigarette users with gender, age, and e-cigarette use included as predictors. Results Of the 69 subjects available for analysis, 36% and 64% reported smoking no cigarettes and no marijuana, respectively, suggesting both outcomes might be zero-inflated. Both outcomes were also overdispersed with large positive skew. The ZINB and HUNB models fit the cigarette counts best. According to goodness-of-fit statistics, the NB, HUNB, and ZINB models fit the marijuana data well, but the ZINB provided better interpretation. Conclusion In the absence of zero-inflation, the NB model fits smoking data well, which is typically overdispersed. In the presence of zero-inflation, the ZINB or HUNB model is recommended to account for additional heterogeneity. In addition to model fit and interpretability, choosing between a zero-inflated or hurdle model should ultimately depend on the assumptions regarding the zeros, study design, and the research question being asked. Implications Count outcomes are frequent in tobacco research and often have many zeros and exhibit large variance and skew. Analyzing such data based on methods requiring a normally distributed outcome are inappropriate and will likely produce spurious results. This study compares and contrasts appropriate methods for analyzing count data, specifically those with an over-abundance of zeros, and illustrates their use on cigarette and marijuana smoking data. Recommendations are provided.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Cannabis Use Is Associated With Increased Risk of Cigarette Smoking Initiation, Persistence, and Relapse Among Adults in the United States",article,['gender'],"Introduction Despite increasing use of cannabis, it is unclear how cannabis use is related to cigarette transitions. This study examined cannabis use and smoking initiation, persistence, and relapse over 1 year among a nationally representative sample of US adults. Methods Data were from US adults (≥18 years) who completed two waves of longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (Wave 1, 2013–2014; Wave 2, 2014–2015; n = 26 341). Logistic regression models were used to calculate the risk of Wave 2 incident smoking among Wave 1 never-smokers, smoking cessation among Wave 1 smokers, and smoking relapse among Wave 1 former smokers by Wave 1 cannabis use. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and education. Results Among Wave 1 never-smokers, cannabis use was associated with increased odds of initiation of nondaily (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.50, 95% confidence limits [CL] = 4.02–7.55) and daily cigarette smoking (AOR = 6.70, 95% CL = 4.75–9.46) 1 year later. Among Wave 1 daily smokers, cannabis use was associated with reduced odds of smoking cessation (AOR = 0.36, 95% CL = 0.20–0.65). Among Wave 1 former smokers, cannabis use was associated with increased odds of relapse to daily and nondaily cigarette smoking (daily AOR = 1.90, 95% CL = 1.11–3.26; nondaily AOR = 2.33, 95% CL = 1.61–3.39). Conclusions Cannabis use was associated with increased cigarette smoking initiation, decreased smoking cessation, and increased smoking relapse among adults in the United States. Increased public education about the relationship between cannabis use and cigarette smoking transitions may be needed as cannabis use becomes more common among US adults. Implications As cannabis use increases in the United States and other countries, an evaluation of the relationships of cannabis use to other health-related behaviors (eg, cigarette smoking) is needed to understand the population-level impact of legalization. Little is known about associations between cannabis use and cigarette smoking transitions (1) using recent longitudinal data, (2) among adults, and (3) examining transitions other than smoking initiation (eg, smoking relapse). Our results suggest that among US adults, cannabis use was associated with increased cigarette smoking initiation among never-smokers, decreased cigarette smoking cessation among current smokers, and increased cigarette smoking relapse among former smokers.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Looming Vulnerability and Smoking Cessation Attempts,article,['sex'],"Introduction The looming vulnerability model holds that people become anxious when they perceive threats as growing larger and accelerating toward them in space and time. Preliminary research suggested that a guided imagery induction designed to activate a sense that health consequences of smoking are a looming threat led more smokers to attempt to quit. This study tested the effect on quit attempts in a larger sample and examined age, sex, and sensation seeking as moderators. Aims and Methods Adult smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day) screened for risk of anxiety or mood disorders (N = 278, 52% male; 77% African American) were randomly assigned to receive (1) looming vulnerability or (2) neutral guided imagery exercises. At a 4-week follow-up, they reported quit attempts, smoking rate, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and contemplation status. Results Those in the looming condition (17%) were no more likely than those in the control condition (20%) to make a quit attempt. There were no significant group differences in expectancies, contemplation, or follow-up smoking rate, and no significant moderators. Conclusions The looming induction was the same one used in earlier work in which it had stronger effects. Those who respond to it with increased urgency about quitting smoking might be offset by others who are more reactant and deny the message. Inconsistencies across studies may reflect differences in inclusion criteria, such that the present sample was on average heavier smokers with longer smoking history and more severe nicotine dependence, yet higher self-efficacy. Implications An induction designed to activate a sense that the health consequences of smoking constitute a looming vulnerability failed to increase quit attempts or reduce smoking rate among adult daily smokers. Inconsistencies across studies might reflect varying sample characteristics resulting from changes in screening criteria.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Smoking Cessation in the ITALUNG Lung Cancer Screening: What Does “Teachable Moment” Mean?,article,['gender'],"Background Changes in smoking habits and predictors of smoking cessation were examined in the randomized ITALUNG lung cancer screening trial. Methods In three centers, eligible smokers or ex-smokers (55–69 years, ≥20 pack-years in the last 10 years) were randomized to receive annual invitation for low-dose computed tomography for 4 years or usual care. At invitation, subjects received written information for a free smoking cessation program. Quitting outcome was assessed at year 4. Results Among participants who completed baseline assessments and year 4 screening, higher quitting (20.8% vs. 16.7%, p = .029) and lower relapse (6.41% vs. 7.56%, p = .50) rates were observed in the active screening group as compared to the usual-care control group. Corresponding figures in the intention-to-treat analysis were as follows: 16.04% versus 14.64% (p = .059) and 4.88% versus 6.43% (p = .26). Quitting smoking was significantly associated to male gender, lower pack-years, and having pulmonary nodules at baseline. Center-specific analyses showed a threefold statistically significant higher probability to quit associated with participating in the smoking cessation program. A subsample of smokers of the scan group from one center showed higher quitting rates over 12-month follow-up as compared to matched controls from the general population who underwent the same smoking cessation program. Conclusions Consistently with previous reports, in the ITALUNG trial, screened subjects showed significantly higher quit rates than controls, and higher quit rates were associated with both the presence of pulmonary nodules and participating in a smoking cessation program. Maximal effect on quitting outcome was observed with the participation in the smoking cessation program. Implications Participating in lung cancer screening promotes smoking cessation. An effective “teachable moment” may be achieved when the smoking cessation intervention is structured as integral part of the screening clinical visits and conducted by a dedicated team of health care professionals. Standardized guidelines for smoking cessation interventions in lung cancer screening are needed.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,History and Correlates of Smoking Cessation Behaviors Among Smokers With Serious Mental Illness,article,['gender'],"Introduction Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) smoke at rates two to three times greater than the general population but are less likely to receive treatment. Increasing our understanding of correlates of smoking cessation behaviors in this group can guide intervention development. Aims and Methods Baseline data from an ongoing trial involving smokers with SMI (N = 482) were used to describe smoking cessation behaviors (ie, quit attempts, quit motivation, and smoking cessation treatment) and correlates of these behaviors (ie, demographics, attitudinal and systems-related variables). Results Forty-three percent of the sample did not report making a quit attempt in the last year, but 44% reported making one to six quit attempts; 43% and 20%, respectively, reported wanting to quit within the next 6 months or the next 30 days. Sixty-one percent used a smoking cessation medication during their quit attempt, while 13% utilized counseling. More quit attempts were associated with lower nicotine dependence and carbon monoxide and greater beliefs about the harms of smoking. Greater quit motivation was associated with lower carbon monoxide, minority race, benefits of cessation counseling, and importance of counseling within the clinic. A greater likelihood of using smoking cessation medications was associated with being female, smoking more cigarettes, and receiving smoking cessation advice. A greater likelihood of using smoking cessation counseling was associated with being male, greater academic achievement, and receiving smoking cessation advice. Conclusions Many smokers with SMI are engaged in efforts to quit smoking. Measures of smoking cessation behavior are associated with tobacco use indicators, beliefs about smoking, race and gender, and receiving cessation advice. Implications Consideration of factors related to cessation behaviors among smokers with SMI continues to be warranted, due to their high smoking rates compared to the general population. Increasing our understanding of these predictive characteristics can help promote higher engagement in evidence-based smoking cessation treatments among this subpopulation.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Long-Term Smoking Cessation Outcomes for Sexual Minority Versus Nonminority Smokers in a Large Randomized Controlled Trial of Two Web-Based Interventions,article,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'sexual minority']","Introduction Despite greater smoking prevalence among sexual minority (SM) individuals relative to non-SM individuals, minimal research has examined whether SM smokers have differential success at quitting, and no prior treatment studies have examined differences within SM subgroups. There is also limited knowledge of the psychosocial characteristics of treatment-seeking SM smokers, which could inform targeted treatments. To address these gaps, we compared treatment outcomes and baseline characteristics for SM and non-SM smokers and for bisexual versus lesbian or gay smokers in a large randomized controlled trial of two web-based cessation treatments. Methods Trial participants completed a survey to assess baseline characteristics, including self-identification as either SM (n = 253; lesbian or gay, n = 122; bisexual, n = 131) or non-SM (n = 2384). The primary cessation outcome was complete-case, self-reported 30-day abstinence at 12 months after randomization. Results Cessation outcomes did not differ significantly for SM versus non-SM smokers (24% vs. 25%, adjusted OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.28) or across SM subgroups (24% for bisexual vs. 23% for lesbian or gay, adjusted OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.51 to 2.00), and there were no interactions with treatment group assignment. At baseline, SM smokers differed from non-SM smokers on most demographics, were more likely to screen positive for all mental health conditions assessed, and had greater exposure to other smokers in the home. Conclusions Substantial differences in baseline characteristics of SM versus non-SM smokers and bisexual versus lesbian or gay smokers did not translate into differential treatment outcomes. Nonetheless, SM smokers’ willingness or ability to quit smoking could be enhanced by taking their unique psychosocial profile into account when designing targeted interventions. Implications The findings of this study, which included the largest sample of SM smokers in a prospective intervention trial to date, support those of a small extant body of literature showing no differences in treatment-assisted cessation outcomes between SM and non-SM smokers. Regardless of their quit rates relative to non-SM smokers, SM smokers’ willingness or ability to quit smoking could potentially be enhanced by taking their unique psychosocial profile into account in intervention design, including their younger age, lower socioeconomic status, greater likelihood of being racial or ethnic minorities, and greater prevalence of mental health symptoms.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Put It Out Project (POP) Facebook Intervention for Young Sexual and Gender Minority Smokers: Outcomes of a Pilot, Randomized, Controlled Trial",article,"['gender', 'gender minority', 'sexual and gender minority']","Introduction This trial investigated whether a Facebook smoking cessation intervention culturally tailored to young sexual and gender minority (SGM) smokers (versus non-tailored) would increase smoking abstinence. Methods Participants were 165 SGM young adult US smokers (age 18–25) recruited from Facebook in April 2018 and randomized to an SGM-tailored (POP; N = 84) or non-tailored (TSP-SGM; N = 81) intervention. Interventions delivered weekly live counseling sessions and 90 daily Facebook posts to participants in Facebook groups. Primary analyses compared POP and TSP-SGM on biochemically verified smoking abstinence (yes/no; primary outcome), self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (yes/no), reduction in cigarettes per week by 50+% from baseline (yes/no), making a quit attempt during treatment (yes/no), and stage of change (precontemplation/contemplation vs. preparation/action). Supplemental analyses compared POP to two historical control groups. Results POP participants were more likely than TSP-SGM participants to report smoking abstinence at 3 (23.8% vs. 12.3%; OR = 2.50; p = .03) and 6 months (34.5% vs. 12.3%; OR = 4.06; p < .001) and reduction in smoking at 3 months (52.4% vs. 39.5%; OR = 2.11; p = .03). Biochemically verified smoking abstinence did not significantly differ between POP and TSP-SGM at 3 (OR = 2.00; p = .33) or 6 months (OR = 3.12; p = .08), potentially due to challenges with remote biochemical verification. In supplemental analyses, POP participants were more likely to report abstinence at 3 (OR = 6.82, p = .01) and 6 (OR = 2.75, p = .03) months and reduced smoking at 3 months (OR = 2.72, p = .01) than participants who received a referral to Smokefree.gov. Conclusions This pilot study provides preliminary support for the effectiveness of a Facebook smoking cessation intervention tailored to SGM young adults. Implications SGM individuals have disproportionately high smoking prevalence. It is unclear whether smoking cessation interventions culturally tailored to the SGM community are more effective than non-tailored interventions. This pilot trial found preliminary evidence that an SGM-tailored Facebook smoking cessation intervention increased reported abstinence from smoking, compared to a non-tailored intervention.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Intersectionality and Smoking Cessation: Exploring Various Approaches for Understanding Health Inequities,article,['gender'],"Objective Many marginalized groups smoke at higher rates and have greater difficulty quitting than less marginalized groups. Most research on smoking cessation inequities has focused on a single sociodemographic attribute (eg, race or socioeconomic status), yet individuals possess multiple attributes that may increase risk. The current study used an intersectionality framework to examine how the interplay between multiple marginalized attributes may impact smoking cessation outcomes. Methods A diverse sample of 344 adults enrolled in a smoking cessation program and reported on sociodemographic attributes (eg, race/ethnicity, gender, income) and continuous smoking abstinence on their quit date and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postquit date. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate whether intersectional links among race/ethnicity, gender, and income were related to smoking cessation outcomes. Results Lower household income may be related to higher risk of smoking cessation failure. There were no significant interactions among race/ethnicity, gender, and income in predicting relapse. Pairwise intersectional group differences suggested some groups may be at higher risk of relapse. Number of marginalized sociodemographic attributes did not predict relapse. Conclusions Intersectionality may be a promising framework for addressing health inequities, and may help elucidate how to best design and target intervention efforts for individuals characterized by sociodemographic intersections that concur particularly high risk for poor tobacco cessation outcomes. Implications Despite an overall decline in smoking rates, socioeconomic inequities in smoking prevalence and cancer mortality are widening. Efforts targeting tobacco cessation should incorporate new theory to capture the complex set of factors that may account for tobacco cessation inequities (eg, multiple aspects of identity that may influence access to tobacco cessation treatment and exposure to certain stressors that impede cessation efforts). Intersectionality may be a promising framework for addressing health inequities in tobacco use and cessation and may help elucidate how to best design and target intervention efforts for individuals that concur particularly high risk for poor tobacco cessation outcomes.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Smoking and Quitting Behavior by Sexual Orientation: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Adults in England,article,"['bisexual', 'bisexuals', 'gay', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'sexual minority', 'sexual orientation']","Objective To assess associations between sexual orientation and smoking and quitting behavior among adults in England. Methods Data were collected from 112 537 adults (≥16 years) participating in a nationally representative monthly cross-sectional survey between July 2013 and February 2019. Sexual orientation was self-reported as heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian/gay, or prefer-not-to-say. Main outcomes were smoking status, e-cigarette use, cigarettes per day, time to first cigarette, motivation to stop smoking, motives for quitting, use of cessation support, and past‐year quit attempts. Associations were analyzed separately for men and women using multivariable regression models adjusted for relevant covariates. Results Smoking prevalence is now similar between gay (21.6%), prefer-not-to-say (20.5%) and heterosexual men (20.0%), and lesbian (18.3%) and heterosexual women (16.9%), but remains higher among bisexual men (28.2%, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.79) and bisexual women (29.8%, ORadj = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.33 to 2.03) and lower among prefer-not-to-say women (14.5%, ORadj = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.72 to 0.99). Among smokers, bisexuals were less addicted than heterosexuals, with bisexual men smoking fewer cigarettes per day (Badj = −2.41, 95% CI = −4.06 to −0.75) and bisexual women less likely to start smoking within 30 min of waking (ORadj = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.95) than heterosexuals. However, motivation to stop smoking and quit attempts did not differ significantly. Conclusions In England, differences in smoking prevalence among people with different sexual orientations have narrowed, primarily driven by a larger decline in smoking rates among sexual minority groups than heterosexuals. Bisexual men and women remain more likely to smoke but have lower levels of addiction while being no less likely to try to quit. Implications This population-based study provides an up-to-date picture of smoking and quitting behavior in relation to sexual orientation among adults in England. Findings suggest that widely documented disparities in smoking prevalence have narrowed over recent years, with gay men and lesbian women no longer significantly more likely to smoke than heterosexuals, although smoking remains more common among bisexual men and women. Insights into differences in level of addiction, use of cessation support, and motives for quitting may help inform the development of targeted interventions to further reduce smoking among sexual minority groups.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,"Role of Smoking in Country Differences in Life Expectancy Across Europe, 1985–2014",article,['sex'],"Introduction Smoking contributes substantially to mortality levels and trends. Its role in country differences in mortality has, however, hardly been quantified. The current study formally assesses the—so far unknown—changing contribution of smoking to country differences in life expectancy at birth (e0) across Europe. Methods Using all-cause mortality data and indirectly estimated smoking-attributable mortality rates by age and sex for 30 European countries from 1985 to 2014, the differences in e0 between each individual European country and the weighted average were decomposed into a smoking- and a nonsmoking-related part. Results In 2014, e0 ranged from 70.8 years in Russia to 83.1 years in Switzerland. Men exhibited larger country differences than women (variance of 21.9 and 7.0 years, respectively). Country differences in e0 increased up to 2005 and declined thereafter. Among men, the average contribution of smoking to the country differences in e0 was highest around 1990 (47%) and declined to 35% in 2014. Among women, the average relative contribution of smoking declined from 1991 to 2011, and smoking resulted in smaller differences with the average e0 level in the majority of European countries. For both sexes combined, the contribution of smoking to country differences in e0 was higher than 20% throughout the period. Conclusions Smoking contributed substantially to the country differences in e0 in Europe, their increases up to 1991, and their decreases since 2005, especially among men. Policies that discourage smoking can help to reduce inequalities in mortality levels across Europe in the long run. Implications Smoking contributes substantially to country differences in life expectancy at birth (e0) in Europe, particularly among men, for whom the contribution was highest around 1990 (47%) and declined to 35% in 2014. In line with the anticipated progression of the smoking epidemic, the differences between European countries in e0 due to smoking are expected to further decline among men, but to increase among women. The role of smoking in mortality convergence since 2005 illustrates that smoking policies can help to reduce inequalities in life expectancy levels across Europe, particularly when they target smoking in countries with low e0.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Meta-Analysis of Cue Reactivity in Tobacco Cigarette Smokers,article,['gender'],"Introduction The cue reactivity paradigm allows for systematic evaluation of motivational responses to drug-related cues that may elicit drug use. The literature on this topic has grown substantially in recent decades, and the methodology used to study cue reactivity has varied widely across studies. The present research provided a meta-analytic investigation of variables that have an impact on cue reactivity effects to enhance our understanding of this key feature of tobacco use disorders. Methods A total of 128 publications yielded 249 effect sizes, which were analyzed to investigate the magnitude of the cue reactivity effect and potential moderators. Results Craving generated a moderate-to-large effect size (Hedges’ g = 0.71, p < .001), indicating that drug cues produced significantly greater craving than neutral cues. However, physiological variables yielded significantly lower or nonsignificant effect sizes. Analyses of a variety of empirically and theoretically relevant moderator variables showed that cue modality, cue personalization, cue reactivity environment, and the use of multiple assessments of cue reactivity were significantly associated with the magnitude of cue-specific craving effects (ps < .001). Effect sizes were not significantly related to abstinence status, gender, cigarettes per day, and treatment-seeking status. Conclusions The results underscored the strength of self-reported craving as an index of cue reactivity across studies, which support theories that posit cue reactivity is core to the addictive process for daily tobacco cigarette smokers. The present research further elucidates the variables that alter the cue reactivity effects across studies and provides recommendations for future cue reactivity research. Implications A core feature of addiction is that drug-related cues can have a major impact on motivational responses across multiple substance use disorders, including tobacco cigarettes. This paper describes a meta-analysis updating and synthesizing cue reactivity research with tobacco cigarette smokers over the last 20 years, a time of rapid growth for this literature. The study leads to a better understanding of the cue reactivity paradigm across different self-report and physiological variables and identifies factors that may modulate addictive motivation for tobacco cigarettes.

Aims and Methods Participants were 1000 smokers recruited worldwide for an online randomized controlled tobacco cessation trial. We examined whether changes in depression severity over time were associated with self-reported 7-day point prevalence smoking status assessed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (FU) using baseline major depressive episode (MDE) history and baseline depression severity as time-invariant covariates. We present depression severity means and smoking abstinence at each FU. Results Regardless of concurrent abstinence status, baseline MDE history was significantly related to depression severity over time: those reporting a past MDE had worse depressive symptoms over time compared with those reporting no MDE history. Baseline depression severity interacted significantly with time-varying abstinence status: for every 1-unit increase in baseline scores on the Center for Epidemiological Studies—Depression Scale (CES-D), individuals who were smoking at FU reported CES-D scores that were 0.17 points higher than those who were abstinent. In this context, nicotine dependence, gender, age, or marital status did not affect depression severity. Conclusions In the context of cessation, having an MDE history plays a significant role in the trajectory of depression severity over the course of 1 year, regardless of abstinence status. Abstinence is related to lower depressive symptoms at each FU, and this effect was stronger at higher levels of baseline depression severity. Implications This study indicates that depressive symptoms are not exacerbated among individuals who are quitting smoking at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month FUs. Depression severity is worse with a baseline history of MDE. Further, those with high baseline depression severity who continue smoking have worse depressive symptoms throughout a 1-year period compared with their abstinent counterparts.

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,High-School Students Rarely Use E-Cigarettes Alone: A Sociodemographic Analysis of Polysubstance Use Among Adolescents in the United States,article,"['bisexual', 'straight']","Introduction Most adolescents reporting e-cigarette use have also used combustible tobacco; however, the extent to which they use other substances is less clear. This study assessed e-cigarette use with tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis and quantified the risk of polysubstance use among adolescents overall and by sociodemographic characteristics. Aims and Methods Using 2017 Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from adolescents (grades 9–12) with complete substance use information (n = 11 244), we examined e-cigarette poly-use status (none [referent], e-cigarettes only, or e-cigarettes + other substances). We estimated the prevalence of substance use and modeled odds of e-cigarette use, alone or with other substances, by several sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses were completed in Stata version 15.1 using survey procedures to account for the complex survey design. Results Approximately 12% of adolescents reported past 30-day e-cigarette use. Almost all (93%) e-cigarette users also reported other substance use; alcohol appeared most frequently in combinations. Odds of e-cigarette single use and e-cigarette poly-use (vs. no use) were higher for males and adolescents with lower grades (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.44–2.31). Racial/ethnic minorities had lower odds of e-cigarette poly-use than White peers (ORs = 0.18–0.61), and bisexual (vs. straight) adolescents were more likely to be e-cigarette poly-users (OR = 1.62). E-cigarette use increased from 9th grade (7%) to 12th grade (16%). Conclusions Polysubstance use is highly prevalent among adolescents who use e-cigarettes. Therefore, e-cigarette screening should include the assessment of other substances, especially alcohol. Early and comprehensive prevention efforts to reduce e-cigarette and other substance use could have a substantial beneficial impact on population health over time. Implications This study extends knowledge about e-cigarette use among adolescents by exploring its use with alcohol, cannabis, and other tobacco products. We found that e-cigarettes were very rarely used alone, and our analysis identified several sociodemographic factors associated with greater odds of e-cigarette polysubstance use. In response, we recommend that prevention interventions address multiple substances concurrently, screen repeatedly to detect new initiation as age increases, focus on e-cigarette use as a less stigmatized entry point to discussions of substance use, and target priority population subgroups.

To describe and characterize the levels of TSNAs in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study Wave 1 (2013–2014), we present four biomarkers of TSNA exposure: N′-nitrosonornicotine, N′-nitrosoanabasine, N′-nitrosoanatabine, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) which is the primary urinary metabolite of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. Methods We measured total TSNAs in 11 522 adults who provided urine using automated solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. After exclusions in this current analysis, we selected 11 004 NNAL results, 10 753 N′-nitrosonornicotine results, 10 919 N′-nitrosoanatabine results, and 10 996 N′-nitrosoanabasine results for data analysis. Geometric means and correlations were calculated using SAS and SUDAAN. Results TSNA concentrations were associated with choice of tobacco product and frequency of use. Among established, every day, exclusive tobacco product users, the geometric mean urinary NNAL concentration was highest for smokeless tobacco users (993.3; 95% confidence interval [CI: 839.2, 1147.3] ng/g creatinine), followed by all types of combustible tobacco product users (285.4; 95% CI: [267.9, 303.0] ng/g creatinine), poly tobacco users (278.6; 95% CI: [254.9, 302.2] ng/g creatinine), and e-cigarette product users (6.3; 95% CI: [4.7, 7.9] ng/g creatinine). TSNA concentrations were higher in every day users than in intermittent users for all the tobacco product groups. Among single product users, exposure to TSNAs differed by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and education. Urinary TSNAs and nicotine metabolite biomarkers were also highly correlated. Conclusions We have provided PATH Study estimates of TSNA exposure among US adult users of a variety of tobacco products. These data can inform future tobacco product and human exposure evaluations and related regulatory activities.

Tobacco Induced Diseases,2018,Harm perceptions of waterpipe tobacco smoking among university students in five Eastern Mediterranean Region countries: A cross-sectional study,RESEARCH PAPER,['gender'],"First Paragraph: The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has some of the highest prevalence rates of waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) and these rates have been increasing over the past two decades1-8. In this region, it is culturally more acceptable for young people to smoke waterpipe than cigarettes. In fact, sharing waterpipe with family members is often how WTS is initiated among the young9-11. In most EMR countries, prevalence rates of WTS are slightly higher in boys. The gender gap in prevalence rates is much larger, however, for cigarette smoking12,13. Such gender differences were attributed to the social acceptability of WTS, especially among girls, compared to cigarette smoking14. Some studies have shown that, among youths in most of the EMR, waterpipe has replaced cigarettes as the most common method of tobacco use15.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.18332/tid/89966,Niveen M.E.

Tobacco Induced Diseases,2019,The association of neighborhood-level social class and tobacco consumption with adverse lung cancer characteristics in Maryland,RESEARCH PAPER,['gender'],"First Paragraph: Evidence linking both active tobacco use and passive second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure to lung cancer is well established, with tobacco exposure accounting for between 80–95% of lung cancers1,2. However, there is also considerable population-level evidence that additional factors, including diet, environmental and occupational exposures, and genetic variation, contribute directly to lung cancer risk, and that some of these factors may modify the effect of tobacco on lung cancer-related outcomes1. Further, there are unanswered questions related to tobacco’s role in differing patterns of lung cancer characteristics by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and social class3-5.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.18332/tid/100525,Ann C.

Tobacco Prevention & Cessation,2018,Sociodemographic correlates of intention to quit smoking for good among U.S. adult menthol and non-menthol smokers: Evidence from the 2013–2014 National Adult Tobacco Survey,SHORT REPORT,"['bisexual', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'transgender']","First Paragraph: Menthol and non-menthol cigarette smoking is associated with smoking-related diseases (i.e. lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease) and premature death1. While the overall prevalence in cigarette smoking has decreased since the mid-20th century, the proportion of menthol cigarette smokers has increased in recent years2,3. Notably, sociodemographic disparities in menthol cigarette smoking persist in the U.S.3. A higher prevalence of menthol cigarette smoking has been documented among vulnerable groups, including Black/African Americans, women, young adults, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals4,5. Such disparities are due, in part, to the targeted marketing of menthol cigarettes by the tobacco industry6,7. Moreover, menthol cigarettes appeal more to novice smokers, and evidence8-10 indicates that the flavor and cooling sensations of menthol mask the harshness of inhaling cigarette smoke and help to facilitate smoking initiation and nicotine dependence.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.18332/tpc/90968,Sabrina L.
