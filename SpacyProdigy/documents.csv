d1,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2018","Title: Situational and Demographic Factors in the Sudden Growth of Pall Mall , 2002–2014 . Objective Pall Mall gained significant brand share in the cigarette market between 2002 and 2013 . We sought to determine whether demographic shifts occurred among the participants reporting Pall Mall as their usual brand during this time span . Method We examined National Survey of Drug Use and Health ( NSDUH ) data from 2002–2014 . Demographic characteristics included age , education , ethnicity , income , and cigarette use ( cigarettes per day , daily / non-daily smoking , and nicotine dependence ) . We also examined RJ Reynolds investor reports and shareholder documents to determine the impact of tobacco marketing on the growth of Pall Mall . Results Over 2002–2014 , Pall Mall has gained among smokers 26 to 34 years of age . More Pall Mall smokers in 2014 report higher incomes ( over $75000 ) , and also report lower scores on measures of cigarette dependence , compared to 2002 . Pall Mall smokers over time seem to share characteristics of premium cigarette brands smokers . Conclusion The profile of the typical Pall Mall smoker has changed as the brand has gained market share . An association exists between brand positioning and economic forces , which has contributed to an increase in the market share for Pall Mall . Implications It is well known that cigarette marketing drives the sale of tobacco products . The growth in the market share of Pall Mall serves as an excellent example to demonstrate how economic uncertainty paired with brand positioning and advertising worked together to serve as a catalyst for the rapid growth observed for this brand . This paper also looked at various demographic changes that occurred among Pall Mall smokers over a 12 year period and compared them to smokers of all other cigarette brands . The results of this analysis demonstrate the importance of monitoring trends over time among cigarette smokers .",1
d2,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2016","Title: Structured Smoking Cessation Training for Medical Students: A Prospective Study . Introduction: Physician adherence to guideline recommendations regarding the provision of counseling and support for smokers willing to quit is low . A lack of training during undergraduate medical education has been identified as a potential cause . This prospective intervention study evaluated a novel teaching module for medical students . Methods: As part of a 6-week cardiovascular course , 125 fourth-year undergraduate medical students received a multimodal and interactive teaching module on smoking cessation , including online learning material , lectures , seminars , and practical skills training . Short- and medium-term effects on knowledge , skills , attitudes , and self-reported practice were measured using written examinations and an objective structured clinical examination at the end of the module and 6 months later . Results were compared to data obtained from a historical control cohort ( n = 70 ) unexposed to the intervention . Results: At the 6-month follow-up , scores in the knowledge test were significantly higher in the intervention than the control group ( 61.1% vs . 51.7%; p < .001 ) . A similar pattern was observed in the objective structured clinical examination ( 71.5% vs . 60.5%; p < .001 ) . More students in the intervention than control group agreed that smoking was a chronic disease ( 83.1% vs . 68.1%; p = .045 ) . The control group was more likely to report recording smoking status ( p = .018 ) , but no group difference was detected regarding the report of advising to quit ( p = .154 ) . Conclusions: A novel teaching module for undergraduate medical students produced a sustained learning outcome in terms of knowledge , skills , and attitudes but not self-reported practice . Implications: Studies across the world have identified considerable knowledge gaps and deficits in practical training with regard to smoking cessation counseling in undergraduate medical students . This paper describes a teaching intervention informed by current recommendations for the design of educational activities aimed at enabling medical students to deliver adequate behavior change counseling . The teaching module was tailored to the needs of a specific healthcare system . Given its effectiveness as demonstrated in this prospective study , a rollout of this intervention in medical schools might have the potential to substantially improve medical students’ knowledge , skills , and attitudes in relation to smoking cessation counseling .",2
d3,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2015","Title: Effects of Nicotine and Nicotine Expectancy on Attentional Bias for Emotional Stimuli . Introduction: Nicotine’s effects on mood are thought to enhance its addictive potential . However , the mechanisms underlying the effects of nicotine on affect regulation have not been reliably demonstrated in human laboratory studies . We investigated the effects of nicotine abstinence ( Experiment 1 ) , and nicotine challenge and expectancy ( Experiment 2 ) on attentional bias towards facial emotional stimuli differing in emotional valence . Methods: In Experiment 1 , 46 nicotine-deprived smokers were randomized to either continue to abstain from smoking or to smoke immediately before testing . In Experiment 2 , 96 nicotine-deprived smokers were randomized to smoke a nicotinized or denicotinized cigarette and to be told that the cigarette did or did not contain nicotine . In both experiments participants completed a visual probe task , where positively valenced ( happy ) and negatively valenced ( sad ) facial expressions were presented , together with neutral facial expressions . Results: In Experiment 1 , there was evidence of an interaction between probe location and abstinence on reaction time , indicating that abstinent smokers showed an attentional bias for neutral stimuli . In Experiment 2 , there was evidence of an interaction between probe location , nicotine challenge and expectation on reaction time , indicating that smokers receiving nicotine , but told that they did not receive nicotine , showed an attentional bias for emotional stimuli . Conclusions: Our data suggest that nicotine abstinence appears to disrupt attentional bias towards emotional facial stimuli . These data provide support for nicotine’s modulation of attentional bias as a central mechanism for maintaining affect regulation in cigarette smoking .",3

Introduction Previous qualitative reviews have summarized evidence of an association between menthol cigarette use and likelihood of smoking cessation . The objective of this meta-analysis was to provide a quantitative summary of effect sizes , their variability , and factors related to the variability in effect size for the association between menthol use and likelihood of smoking cessation . Methods We systematically searched Medline , PsycINFO , and Embase for prospective and cross-sectional studies of the association between menthol use and smoking cessation . We analyzed data with random effects meta-analyses and meta-regression . Results Our review identified 22 reports from 19 studies of the association between menthol use and cessation . All identified study samples included only US smokers , with one exception that included both Canadian and US smokers . Our overall model did not demonstrate a significant association between menthol use and cessation; however , menthol users were significantly less likely to quit among blacks / African American smokers ( odds ratio = 0.88 ) . Conclusions Among blacks / African Americans predominantly in the US menthol users have approximately 12% lower odds of smoking cessation compared to non-menthol users . This difference is likely the result of the tobacco industry’s ongoing marketing influence on the black / African American Community , suggesting that a menthol ban may have a unique public health benefit for black / African American smokers by encouraging quitting behavior . Implications This study adds a quantitative summary of the association between menthol cigarette use and smoking cessation in the United States . Findings of an association with lower likelihood of cessation among black / African American smokers , likely resulting from the tobacco industry’s marketing influence , support the ban of menthol flavoring as part of a comprehensive tobacco control effort to increase cessation among black / African American smokers .",4
d5,"Tobacco Control, 2020","Title: Evidence that an intervention weakens the relationship between adolescent electronic cigarette use and tobacco smoking: a 24-month prospective study . Background The electronic cigarette ( e-cigarette ) use to subsequent smoking relationship in adolescents has received much attention . Whether an intervention to reduce smoking initiation attenuated this relationship was assessed . Method Data were from 3994 adolescent never smokers ( aged 13–14 years at baseline ) as part of a cluster randomised controlled trial . Self-report measures of smoking , e-cigarette use and covariates were assessed and used to predict ever smoked cigarettes , any recent tobacco smoking and regularly smoked cigarettes at 24-month follow-up . Results Baseline ever use of e-cigarettes was associated with ever smoked cigarettes ( OR=4.03 , 95% CI 3.33 to 4.88; controlling for covariates , OR=2.78 , 95% CI 2.20 to 3.51 ) , any recent tobacco smoking ( OR=3.38 , 95% CI 2.72 to 4.21; controlling for covariates , OR=2.17 , 95% CI 1.76 to 2.69 ) and regularly smoked cigarettes ( OR=3.60 , 95% CI 2.35 to 5.51; controlling for covariates , OR=1.27 , 95% CI 1.17 to 1.39 ) at follow-up . For ever smoked cigarettes only , the impact of e-cigarette use was attenuated in the intervention ( OR=1.83 ) compared with control ( OR=4.53 ) condition . For ever smoked cigarettes and any recent tobacco smoking , the impact of e-cigarette use was attenuated among those with friends who smoked ( OR=2.05 ( ever smoked ); 1·53 ( any tobacco use ) ) compared with those without friends who smoked ( OR=3.32 ( ever smoked ); 2·17 ( any tobacco use ) ) . Conclusions This is one of the first studies to show that e-cigarette use was robustly associated with measures of smoking over 24 months and the first to show an intervention to attenuate the relationship . Further research with a broader age range of adolescents is required . Highlights: Previous research: A growing number of studies ( mainly among US and UK adolescents ) indicate that self-reported e-cigarette use is associated with subsequent smoking initiation . However , in general , these studies were conducted over relatively short time periods ( 12 months ) , focused only on smoking initiation and not on more regular smoking , did not validate their self-reported smoking measures against objective measures and did not examine the impact of smoking prevention interventions . Interpretation: The present research replicates previous findings in this area in showing a significant association between e-cigarette use and subsequent smoking initiation . It also shows similar effects for measures of regular smoking . These relationships were observed over a period of 24 months in measures of ever smoked cigarettes , any recent tobacco smoking and regularly smoked cigarettes . The strength of these associations was reduced but remained significant when controlling for various predictors of smoking . Importantly , the present research showed for the first time that an intervention to reduce smoking initiation attenuated the relationship between e-cigarette use and ever smoked cigarettes ( although it remained significant ) . This suggests the value of interventions to reduce smoking initiation even in groups of adolescents who try e-cigarettes first . Similar to recent UK studies , the present data also showed that the relationship between e-cigarette use and ever smoked cigarettes or any recent tobacco smoking was stronger in those with no friends who smoked at baseline ( a group usually thought to be at low risk of starting smoking ) versus some friends who smoked at the initial time point . These latter findings are more consistent with the view that e-cigarette use is a risk factor for smoking initiation than the view that e-cigarette use may simply be a marker for those who would go on to smoke cigarettes even without having tried e-cigarettes . However , it is notable that this moderation effect was not observed for regular smoking .",5
d6,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2018","Title: Tobacco Consumption and Toxicant Exposure of Cigarette Smokers Using Electronic Cigarettes . Background There is considerable debate about the benefits and risks of electronic cigarettes ( ECs ) . To better understand the risk–benefit ratio of ECs , more information is needed about net nicotine consumption and toxicant exposure of cigarette smokers switching to ECs . Methods Forty cigarette smokers ( ≥1 year of smoking ) interested in switching to ECs but not necessarily quitting smoking were enrolled in a 4-week observational study and provided an e-Go C non-variable battery and refillable atomizers and choice of eight flavors in 12 or 24 mg nicotine dosage . Measurement of urinary cotinine ( metabolite of nicotine ) , 4-( methylnitrosamino )-1-( 3-pyridyl )-1-butanol ( NNAL; a pulmonary carcinogen ) , and eight volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) that are toxic tobacco smoke constituents was conducted at baseline and week 4 . Results All participants with follow-up data ( 92.5% ) reported using the study EC . Of the 40 smokers , 16 reported no cigarettes at week 2 ( 40% ) and six continued to report no cigarettes at week 4 ( 15% ) . Change in nicotine intake over the 4 weeks was non-significant ( p = .90 ) . Carbon monoxide ( p < .001 ) , NNAL ( p < .01 ) and metabolites of benzene ( p < .01 ) and acrylonitrile ( p = .001 ) were significantly decreased in the study sample . Smokers switching exclusively to ECs for at least half of the study period demonstrated significant reductions in metabolites of ethylene oxide ( p = .03 ) and acrylamide ( p < .01 ) . Conclusion Smokers using ECs over 4 weeks maintained cotinine levels and experienced significant reductions in carbon monoxide , NNAL , and two out of eight measured VOC metabolites . Those who switched exclusively to ECs for at least half of the study period significantly reduced two additional VOCs . Implications This study extends current literature by measuring change in smoking dependence and disease-associated biomarkers , NNAL and a panel of eight common VOCs that are toxic tobacco smoke constituents in smokers who switch to ECs . The findings support the idea of harm reduction , however some levels of toxicant exposure are still of clinical concern , particularly for dual users . Extrapolation of these results must be careful to separate the different toxic exposure results for exclusive switchers versus dual cigarette + EC users , and not to equate harm reduction with the idea that using ECs is harmless .",6
d7,"Tobacco Control, 2018","Title: Effect of message congruency on attention and recall in pictorial health warning labels . Objective The nine pictorial health warning labels ( PWLs ) proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration vary in format and feature of visual and textual information . Congruency is the degree to which visual and textual features reflect a common theme . This characteristic can affect attention and recall of label content . This study investigates the effect of congruency in PWLs on smoker’s attention and recall of label content . Methods 120 daily smokers were randomly assigned to view either congruent or incongruent PWLs , while having their eye movements recorded . Participants were asked to recall label content immediately after exposure and 5 days later . Results Overall , the image was viewed more and recalled better than the text . Smokers in the incongruent condition spent more time focusing on the text than smokers in the congruent condition ( p=0.03 ) , but dwell time of the image did not differ . Despite lower dwell time on the text , smokers in the congruent condition were more likely to correctly recall it on day 1 ( p=0.02 ) and the risk message of the PWLs on both day 1 ( p=0.01 ) and day 5 ( p=0.006 ) than smokers in the incongruent condition . Conclusions This study identifies an important design feature of PWLs and demonstrates objective differences in how smokers process PWLs . Our results suggest that message congruency between visual and textual information is beneficial to recall of label content . Moreover , images captured and held smokers’ attention better than the text . Highlights: Images in pictorial health warning labels capture and hold attention , as objectively measured with eye tracking . Results suggest that images capture and hold smokers’ attention better than text . Congruency , the degree to which visual and textual features reflect a common theme , is beneficial to memory of label content . Purely factual text information supported by congruent images maybe an important policy approach .",7

Introduction: In recent years , waterpipe tobacco smoking has been increasing in popularity all over the world . In this study , we explored effects of waterpipe smoking on pregnancy outcomes in rats . Methods: Animals were exposed to waterpipe tobacco smoking using a whole body exposure system 2 hours per day during pregnancy . A control group was exposed to fresh air only . Results: The results showed significant association between exposure to waterpipe smoke during pregnancy and low birth weight ( P < .01 ) and neonatal death ( P < .01 ) . In addition , the rate of growth of offspring of the waterpipe group was significantly lower than that of control group as measured by body weight gain during the first 3 months of life ( P < .001 ) . No effect was found for waterpipe smoking on mean number of progeny and male to female ratio among offspring . Conclusion: Waterpipe smoking is associated with adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes . Implications: In this study , we investigated for the first time the effect of waterpipe smoking on pregnancy outcomes using animal model . The results clearly showed that waterpipe smoking is associated with adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes that include low birth weigh , neonatal survival , and growth retardation .",8

Background Few studies have examined the extent of inhalation or dermal contact among bystanders following short-term , secondhand e-cigarette exposure . Objective Measure PM2.5 ( particles < 2.5 microns ) , UF ( ultrafine particles < 100 nm ) , and nicotine in air and deposited on surfaces and clothing pre- / during / post- a short-term ( 2-hour ) e-cigarette exposure . Methods E-cigarettes were used ad libitum by three experienced users for 2 hours during two separate sessions ( disposable e-cigarettes , then tank-style e-cigarettes , or “tanks” ) in a 1858 ft3 room . We recorded: uncorrected PM2.5 ( using SidePak ); UF ( using P-Trak ); air nicotine concentrations ( using air samplers; SKC XAD-4 canisters ); ambient air exchange rate ( using an air capture hood ) . Wipe samples were taken by wiping 100 cm2 room surfaces pre- and post- both sessions , and clean cloth wipes were worn during the exposure and collected at the end . Results Uncorrected PM2.5 and UF were higher ( p < .0001 ) during sessions than before or after . Median PM2.5 during exposure was higher using tanks ( 0.515 mg / m3 ) than disposables ( 0.035 mg / m3 ) ( p < .0001 ) . Median UF during exposure was higher using disposables ( 31 200 particles / cm3 ) than tanks ( 25 200 particles / cm3 )( p < .0001 ) . Median air nicotine levels were higher ( p < .05 ) during both sessions ( disposables = 0.697 ng / L , tanks = 1.833 ng / L ) than before ( disposables = 0.004 ng / L , tanks = 0.010 ng / L ) or after ( disposables = 0.115 ng / L , tanks = 0.147 ng / L ) . Median accumulation rates of nicotine on surface samples were 2.1 ng / 100 cm2 / h using disposables and 4.0 ng / 100 cm2 / h using tanks; for cloth samples , it was 44.4 ng / 100 cm2 / h using disposables and 69.6 ng / 100 cm2 / h using tanks ( p < .01 ) . Mean room ventilation rate was ~5 air changes per hour during both sessions . Conclusions Short-term e-cigarette use can produce: elevated PM2.5; elevated UF; nicotine in the air; and accumulation of nicotine on surfaces and clothing . Implications Short-term indoor e-cigarette use produced accumulation of nicotine on surfaces and clothing , which could lead to dermal exposure to nicotine . Short-term e-cigarette use produced elevated PM2.5 and ultrafine particles , which could lead to secondhand inhalation of these particles and any chemicals associated with them by bystanders . We measured significant differences in PM2.5 and ultrafine particles between disposable e-cigarettes and tank-style e-cigarettes , suggesting a difference in the exposure profiles of e-cigarette products .",9

First Paragraph: Resveratrol , a naturally occurring phytoalexin and a phenolic compound found in grape skins , mulberries , and certain nuts , is anti-tumorigenic , anti-inflammatory1-3 and possess antioxidant properties1,4 . Resveratrol acts also as a potential cardio-protective agent as it was shown that red wine consumption ( a source of resveratrol ) is inversely related to cardiovascular disease5,6 . Besides cardioprotective effects , resveratrol exhibits anticancer activities through a variety of regulatory pathways7-10 , as documented in several reviews1,2,11,12 . In vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed that resveratrol can modulate multiple pathways involved in cell growth , apoptosis , and inflammation13-15 . Yet , the mechanism aspects of this polyphenol are not completely understood and still under considerable investigation . Jang et al.3 reported that chemo-preventative activity of resveratrol may involve three major phases , such as inhibition of cell proliferation , induction of apoptosis , and decreases in cancer progression . Although multiple pathways towards those mechanisms have been investigated16-18 , the precise mechanism of the anti-proliferative effects of resveratrol , in particular reference to pancreatic cancer , has not been fully evaluated . Golkar et al.7 demonstrated that resveratrolinduced growth inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated in part by up-regulation of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 ( MIC-1 ) . In human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and AsPC-1 , resveratrol was shown to inhibit proliferation through apoptosis8.",11

Introduction: Negative affect has been identified as a factor influencing continued smoking during pregnancy . In this study , a multi-component emotion regulation intervention was developed to address negative emotional smoking triggers and pilot-tested among low-income pregnant smokers . Treatment feasibility and acceptability , cotinine-verified rates of smoking cessation , and self-report of mean cigarettes smoked were assessed . Methods: Pregnant smokers who self-reported smoking in response to negative affect ( N = 70 ) were randomly assigned to receive one of two 8-session interventions: ( 1 ) emotion regulation treatment combined with standard cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation ( ERT + CBT ) or ( 2 ) a health and lifestyle plus standard smoking cessation active control ( HLS + CBT ) . Outcomes for the 4-month period following the quit date are reported . Results: Treatment attendance and subjective ratings provide evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of the ERT + CBT intervention . Compared with the HLS + CBT control condition , the ERT + CBT condition demonstrated higher abstinence rates at 2 months ( ERT + CBT = 23% vs . HLS + CBT = 0% , OR = 13.51; 95% CI = 0.70–261.59 ) and 4 months ( ERT = 18% vs . HLS = 5%; OR = 2.98; 95% CI = 0.39–22.72 ) post-quit . Mean number of cigarettes per day was significantly lower in ERT + CBT at 2 months ( ERT + CBT = 2.73 ( 3.35 ) vs . HLS + CBT = 5.84 ( 6.24 ); p = .05 ) but not at 4 months ( ERT + CBT = 2.15 ( 3.17 ) vs . HLS + CBT = 5.18 ( 2.88 ); p = .06 ) post-quit . Conclusions: The development and initial test of the ERT + CBT intervention supports its feasibility and acceptability in this difficult-to-treat population . Further development and testing in a Stage II randomized clinical trial are warranted . Implications: Negative affect has been identified as a motivator for continued smoking during pregnancy . To date , smoking cessation interventions for pregnant smokers have not specifically addressed the role of negative affect as a smoking trigger . This treatment development pilot study provides support for the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component ERT + CBT for low-income pregnant smokers who self-report smoking in response to negative affect . Study findings support further testing in a fully-powered Stage II efficacy trial powered to assess mediators and moderators of treatment effects .",12

In the context of continued uncertainty regarding the long-term mental health effects of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy , we read with great interest the recently published meta-analysis of smoking and schizophrenia by Hunter and colleagues . Although the meta-analysis found that “exposure to prenatal smoke increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29%” ( p . 3 ) , the authors noted that “familial confounding may explain some of the observed association” ( p . 8 ) . We agree with the importance of this alternative hypothesis . In fact , we were surprised that the review did not consider the results of sibling comparison studies that have directly addressed it , particularly given that the review had the opportunity to do so using data from articles included in the meta-analysis . As we illustrate below—and as has been discussed previously—we are concerned that limiting the focus of the review to only findings potentially subject to familial confounding rather than incorporating these sibling comparison results may lead to inaccurate inferences from the reviewed literature.",13
d14,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2015","Title: Change in Body Weight Does Not Mediate the Relationship Between Exercise and Smoking Cessation Among Weight-Concerned Women Smokers . Introduction: Exercise has received attention as a method to prevent or reduce postcessation weight gain . However , little is known about how weight changes following quit attempts contribute to the relationship between exercise and smoking cessation . The present study assessed how exercise relates to cessation and whether initial changes in exercise after quitting smoking promote cessation through attenuated weight gain . Methods: Weight-concerned women smokers ( N = 342 ) receiving cessation treatment provided biochemical validation of cessation , reported weekly exercise activities , and were weighed at 1 , 3 , and 6 months following treatment initiation . Survival analyses were used to determine time to and risk of relapse among women who reported engaging in varied levels of exercise at baseline . A mediation analysis was used to examine whether the effect of initial changes in exercise on longer-term cessation was driven by change in weight . All analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates . Results: Women smokers who reported high levels of exercise at baseline were less likely to relapse and returned to smoking more gradually than did women who reported low levels of exercise . Change in weight did not mediate the relationship between exercise and cessation . Conclusions: Cessation interventions utilizing an exercise component may have to develop exercise regimens of either higher duration or greater intensity to produce beneficial cessation outcomes , particularly when targeting sedentary smokers . Given that change in weight did not mediate the relationship between exercise and cessation , it is likely that other mediational processes are involved .",14
d15,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2019","Title: Marketing Influences on Perceptions of Reduced Nicotine Content Cigarettes . Introduction The Food and Drug Administration announced intent to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes . There is limited evidence on how reduced nicotine content cigarette ( RNC ) marketing affects product beliefs and use , and research on this is needed to inform regulations . Methods In an online experiment , 426 young adult cigarette smokers ( aged 18–30 years ) were randomized in a 2 ( implicit: red package vs . blue package ) × 2 ( explicit: corrective message vs . no corrective message ) design to view an advertisement for previously commercially available RNCs . Outcomes were advertisement content recall , product beliefs , and use intentions . Participants’ responses to open-ended assessment of their beliefs about the stimuli were coded to identify prevailing themes . Results Red packaging and corrective messaging were independently associated with greater advertisement content recall ( p = .01 and p = .04 , respectively ) . There were no significant main or interaction effects on product beliefs or use intentions . Controlling for condition , advertisement content recall was significantly associated with less favorable product beliefs ( p < .001 ) and favorable product beliefs were associated with intent to use the product ( p < .001 ) . Open-ended responses converged on the finding that respondents were interested in RNCs , but expressed skepticism about effectiveness and value . Conclusions Brief exposure to an RNC advertisement with red packaging and corrective messaging were each independently associated with greater advertisement content recall . The results indicate: ( 1 ) interest and confusion among young adult smokers regarding RNCs , ( 2 ) beliefs about RNCs are influenced by marketing , and ( 3 ) beliefs are associated with intention to use RNCs . Implications Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of advertising effects on beliefs about RNC products and support the need to regulate advertising and labeling alongside product regulation . More detailed study of advertisement features that affect consumers’ beliefs about RNCs and how they impact their processing of explicit messaging about product risks will be important to guide regulatory decision-making .",15
d16,"Tobacco Control, 2018","Title: Seven years of progress in tobacco control: an evaluation of the effect of nations meeting the highest level MPOWER measures between 2007 and 2014 . Objective Since WHO released the package of six MPOWER measures to assist nations with implementing the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control ( FCTC ) , 88 countries adopted at least one highest level MPOWER measure . We estimated the subsequent reduction in smoking-related deaths from all new highest level measures adopted between 2007 and 2014 . Methods Policy effect sizes based on previously validated SimSmoke models were applied to the number of smokers in each nation to determine the reduction in the number of smokers from policy adoption . On the basis of research that half of all smokers die from smoking , we derived the smoking-attributable deaths ( SADs ) averted of those smokers alive today . Findings In total , 88 countries adopted at least one highest level MPOWER policy between 2007 and 2014 , resulting in almost 22 million fewer projected SADs . The largest number of future SADs averted was due to increased cigarette taxes ( 7.0 million ) , followed by comprehensive smoke-free laws ( 5.4 million ) , large graphic health warnings ( 4.1 million ) , comprehensive marketing bans ( 3.8 million ) and comprehensive cessation interventions ( 1.5 million ) . Conclusions These findings demonstrate the immense public health impact of tobacco control policies adopted globally since the WHO-FCTC and highlight the importance of more countries adopting highest level MPOWER measures to reduce the global burden of tobacco use . Substantial additional progress could be made , especially if heavily populated nations with high smoking prevalence were to reach highest level MPOWER measures . Highlights: A previous paper estimated that implementing highest level MPOWER policies between 2007 and 2010 averted about seven million premature deaths . This paper extends the previous analysis to include 2007 through 2014 . In total , 88 countries adopted at least one highest level MPOWER policy , resulting in almost 22 million fewer premature deaths . The largest number of deaths averted was due to increased cigarette taxes ( 7.0 million ) , followed by comprehensive smoke-free laws ( 5.4 million ) , large graphic health warnings ( 4.1 million ) , comprehensive marketing bans ( 3.8 million ) and comprehensive cessation interventions ( 1.5 million ) .",16

Introduction: Electronic cigarettes ( e-cigs ) are becoming increasingly popular but little is known about how e-cig users’ transition between the different device types and what device characteristics and preferences may influence the transition . Methods: Four thousand four hundred twenty-one experienced e-cig users completed an online survey about their e-cig use , devices , and preferences . Participants included in analysis were ever cigarette smokers who used an e-cig at least 30 days in their lifetime and who reported the type of their first and current e-cig device and the nicotine concentration of their liquid . Analyses focused on transitions between “first generation” devices ( same size as a cigarette with no button ) and “advanced generation” devices ( larger than a cigarette with a manual button ) and differences between current users of each device type . Results: Most e-cig users ( n = 2603 , 58.9% ) began use with a first generation device , and of these users , 63.7% subsequently transitioned to current use of an advanced generation device . Among users who began use with an advanced generation device ( n = 1818 , 41.1% ) , only 5.7% transitioned to a first generation device . Seventy-seven percent of current advanced generation e-cig users switched to their current device in order to obtain a “more satisfying hit.” Battery capabilities and liquid flavor choices also influenced device choice . Conclusion: E-cig users commonly begin use with a device shaped like a cigarette and transition to a larger device with a more powerful battery , a button for manual activation and a wider choice of liquid flavors .",17

Introduction In recent years , e-cigarettes overtook cigarettes as the leading tobacco product used by US adolescents . Most states , as well as federal regulations , have added e-cigarettes to laws prohibiting tobacco products sales to minors . We tested compliance with the newer regulation among Colorado urban retail businesses , speculating that violations might be more common for e-cigarettes than smokable cigarettes . Methods Supervised minors visited a random sample of urban businesses and sequentially attempted to purchase an e-cigarette product and cigarettes . The protocol prescribed that the same minor make both attempts in each business , separated by at least a day to minimize influence of the first result on the second result . Data were collected during May 2014–January 2015 . Results Among 238 businesses , more than one-fourth ( 26.1%; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 18.9%–33.2% ) sold at least one type of product , and 6.3% ( CI , 1.8%–10.8% ) sold both types . Violation rates were similar for e-cigarette products and cigarettes ( 17.6% vs . 14.7% , p = n.s. ) . Conclusion Enforcement to prevent retail tobacco sales to adolescents should include e-cigarette products . Dual testing of stores indicates that single visits underestimate the problem of underage tobacco sales . Implications Adolescents can buy e-cigarettes from retail stores as easily as they buy cigarettes . Enforcement of tobacco sales laws should include e-cigarettes , and test–retest protocols are needed to estimate the true extent of the problem .",18
d19,"Tobacco Control, 2019","Title: Secondhand smoke exposure during pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis of data from Demographic and Health Survey from 30 low-income and middle-income countries . Background Secondhand smoke ( SHS ) exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of infant stillbirth , congenital malformations , low birth weight and respiratory illnesses . However , little is known about the extent of SHS exposure during pregnancy . We assessed the prevalence of SHS exposure in pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) . Methods We used Demographic and Health Survey data collected between 2008 and 2013 from 30 LMICs . We estimated weighted country-specific prevalence of SHS exposure among 37 427 pregnant women . We accounted for sampling weights , clustering and stratification in the sampling methods . We also explored associations between sociodemographic variables and SHS exposure in pregnant women using pairwise multinomial regression model . Findings The prevalence of daily SHS exposure during pregnancy ranged from 6% ( 95% CI 5% to 7% ) ( Nigeria ) to 73% ( 95% CI 62% to 81% ) ( Armenia ) and was greater than active tobacco use in pregnancy across all countries studied . Being wealthier , maternal employment , higher education and urban households were associated with lower SHS exposure in full regression models . SHS exposure in pregnant women closely mirrors WHO Global Adult Tobacco Survey male active smoking patterns . Daily SHS exposure accounted for a greater population attributable fraction of stillbirths than active smoking , ranging from 1% of stillbirths ( Nigeria ) to 14% ( Indonesia ) . Interpretation We have demonstrated that SHS exposure during pregnancy is far more common than active smoking in LMICs , accounting for more stillbirths than active smoking . Protecting pregnant women from SHS exposure should be a key strategy to improve maternal and child health . Highlights: Three primary research articles are published describing the prevalence of secondhand smoke ( SHS ) exposure in pregnancy in low-income and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) that focus on 11 countries in total . These papers demonstrate that in the countries studied , maternal exposure to SHS is common , from 17.1% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 91.6% in Pakistan . This represents an emerging problem for LMICs in tackling maternal and child health . Only one research article from Bangladesh provided prevalence data on country-level nationally representative samples . While national prevalence estimates are available for active smoking during pregnancy for many LMICs , such data are not available to describe the prevalence of SHS exposure during pregnancy . This is the first study which provides national estimates for 30 LMICs on SHS exposure in pregnancy and shows that these estimates are much higher than active smoking during pregnancy . For these countries , the estimated population attributable risk due to SHS exposure during pregnancy could be higher than that due to active smoking .",19
d20,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2021","Title: Vape Shop Owners / Managers’ Opinions About FDA Regulation of E-Cigarettes . Introduction In the United States , prominent sources of vaping products are specialty vape shops , which are subject to Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulation . This study interviewed vape shop owners / managers to assess: ( 1 ) reasons for entering into or engaging in vape shop retail; ( 2 ) personnel training , particularly with regard to FDA and state regulations; and ( 3 ) how existing regulations are perceived and the anticipated impact of future regulation . Aims and Methods The current study involved phone–based semi-structured interviews of 45 vape shop owners / managers in six metropolitan statistical areas ( Atlanta , Boston , Minneapolis , Oklahoma City , San Diego , and Seattle ) during Summer 2018 as FDA regulations regarding minimum age verification , bans on product sampling , and health warnings ( among others ) were first being implemented . Results Vape shop owners / managers reported: ( 1 ) entering the industry with positive intentions for their customers , ( 2 ) training their personnel to adhere to regulations and provide good customer service , and ( 3 ) significant concerns about the impact of FDA regulations . With regard to the latter , participants reported mistrust of the intentions of the FDA regulations , financial implications of the regulations ( particularly for small businesses ) , difficulty understanding and interpreting the regulations , insufficient evidence to support the regulations , negative impact on customer service , negative impact on product offerings and product innovation / advancement , and negative implications of flavor bans and / or restrictions on sale of flavors . Conclusions These findings indicate the complexities in implementing tobacco regulations , particularly from the perspective of the vape shop industry . Current findings should inform future regulatory actions and efforts to assess compliance with regulations . Implications Current and impending FDA regulation of vaping products present a critical period for examining regulatory impact on the vape shop industry . Current results indicated that many vape shop owners / managers reporting positive intentions for engaging in the vaping product industry and in training vape shop personnel to adhere to regulations . However , the majority reported concerns about FDA regulation and other state / local regulations that could have negative implications for their industry . Particular concerns include difficulty understanding the regulations due to complexity , vagueness , and changes in language and / or interpretation over time . These issues have implications for compliance that must be addressed .",20
