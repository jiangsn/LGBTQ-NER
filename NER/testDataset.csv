684,Tobacco Control,2019,"Is blue the new green? Repackaging menthol cigarettes in response to a flavour ban in Ontario, Canada",Brief Report,"Background As of 1 January 2017, the Canadian province of Ontario banned the distribution and sale of menthol tobacco products. There is limited knowledge about how tobacco companies will adapt their packaging in response to a menthol ban. Methods We conducted a content analysis of preban traditional menthol (no capsule) and menthol capsule cigarette packs and their postban replacements. Preban and postban packs were matched using tobacco company descriptions of replacement brands in business-to-business marketing materials, advertising on cigarette pack cellophane and a tobacco company website. Results A total of 63 menthol (n=30) and ‘non-menthol alternative’ (n=33) cigarette packs were included in the analysis. Approximately half of the preban packs were menthol capsule cigarettes and half traditional menthol cigarettes. While some postban brands continued to convey menthol-like qualities via the colour and/or brand descriptor ‘green’, ’blue' was the most common colour and brand descriptor postban. Packs shifted from using ‘menthol’ and/or ‘fresh’ as taste descriptor preban to using ‘smooth’ postban; some postban packs had ‘non-menthol alternative’ or ‘without menthol/capsules’ written on their cellophane. The presence of innovative filter technologies continued in the postban samples. Conclusion Results suggest that tobacco companies attempted to maintain menthol smokers in Ontario by aggressive preban promotion of menthol capsule cigarettes, continued promotion of innovative filter technologies and by directing smokers to non-menthol alternatives whose packaging both in text and in colour connoted menthol-like qualities (eg, green) and reduced harshness or harm (eg, blue, white, silver, smooth taste). ","There is limited knowledge about how tobacco companies will adapt their products and packaging in response to a menthol ban. In Ontario, tobacco companies developed a menthol replacement system of non-menthol alternative packaging and branding and promoted these alternatives to tobacco vendors and menthol consumers. Tobacco companies attempted to maintain menthol smokers by promoting capsule cigarettes as a way to transition onto non-menthol cigarettes; continuing to offer innovative filter technologies postban; and recommending non-menthol alternatives that communicated menthol-like qualities and/or reduced harshness and reduced harm (eg, green, blue, white, silver, smooth taste).

2148,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Prescribing Prevalence, Effectiveness, and Mental Health Safety of Smoking Cessation Medicines in Patients With Mental Disorders",article,"Objective We conducted a prospective cohort study of the Clinical Practice Research Database to estimate rates of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) prescribing and the relative effects on smoking cessation, and mental health. Methods We used multivariable logistic regression, propensity score matched regression, and instrumental variable analysis. Exposure was varenicline or NRT prescription. Mental disorders were bipolar, depression, neurotic disorder, schizophrenia, or prescriptions of antidepressants, antipsychotics, hypnotics/anxiolytics, mood stabilizers. Outcomes were smoking cessation, and incidence of neurotic disorder, depression, prescription of antidepressants, or hypnotics/anxiolytics. Follow-ups were 3, 6, and 9 months, and at 1, 2, and 4 years. Results In all patients, NRT and varenicline prescribing declined during the study period. Seventy-eight thousand four hundred fifty-seven smokers with mental disorders aged ≥18 years were prescribed NRT (N = 59 340) or varenicline (N = 19 117) from September 1, 2006 to December 31, 2015. Compared with smokers without mental disorders, smokers with mental disorders had 31% (95% CI: 29% to 33%) lower odds of being prescribed varenicline relative to NRT, but had 19% (95% CI: 15% to 24%) greater odds of quitting at 2 years when prescribed varenicline relative to NRT. Overall, varenicline was associated with decreased or similar odds of worse mental health outcomes than NRT in patients both with and without mental disorders, although there was some variation when analyses were stratified by mental disorder subgroup. Conclusions Smoking cessation medication prescribing may be declining in primary care. Varenicline was more effective than NRT for smoking cessation in patients with mental disorders and there is not clear consistent evidence that varenicline is adversely associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Implications Patients with mental disorders were less likely to be prescribed varenicline than NRT. We triangulated results from three analytical techniques. We found that varenicline was more effective than NRT for smoking cessation in patients with mental disorders. Varenicline was generally associated with similar or decreased odds of poorer mental health outcomes (ie, improvements in mental health) when compared with NRT. We report these findings cautiously as our data are observational and are at risk of confounding.

2501,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Trends in Social Norms Towards Smoking Between 2002 and 2015 Among Daily Smokers: Findings From the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC 4C),article,"Objective To assess trends in daily smokers' social norms and opinions of smoking between 2002 and 2015 in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Method Data were from wave 1 (2002) to wave 9 (2013–2015) of the longitudinal International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia), involving 23 831 adult daily smokers. Generalized estimating equation logistic regression models, adjusted for demographics and survey design effects, assessed associations of wave and country with outcomes: (A) over half of five closest friends smoke, (B) agreeing that people important to you believe you should not smoke, (C) agreeing that society disapproves of smoking, and (D) negative opinion of smoking. Results Between 2002 and 2015, adjusting for covariates, (A) over half of five closest friends smoke did not change (56% vs. 55%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.95 [95% Confidence Interval = 0.85–1.07]), (B) agreeing that people important to you believe you should not smoke generally decreased (89% vs. 82%; AOR = 0.54 [0.46–0.64]) despite an increase around 2006–2007, (C) agreeing that society disapproves of smoking increased between 2002 and 2006–2007 (83% vs. 87%; AOR = 1.38 [1.24–1.54]) then decreased until 2013–2015 (78%; AOR = 0.74 [0.63–0.88]), and (D) negative opinion of smoking decreased between 2002 and 2010–2011 (54% vs. 49%; AOR = 0.83 [0.75–0.91]) despite an increase around 2005–2006 and at the final wave (2013–2015). Except friend smoking, Canada had the greatest, and the United Kingdom the lowest, antismoking social norms and opinions. Conclusions Except friend smoking and opinion of smoking, daily smokers' social norms became less antismoking between 2002 and 2015 despite increases around 2006–2007. Several potential explanations are discussed yet remain undetermined. Implications Increasingly comprehensive tobacco control policies alongside decreasing smoking prevalence in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have led to the assumption that smoking has become denormalized in these countries. Absent from the literature is any formal assessment of social norms towards smoking over time. Contrary to our hypotheses, this study found that the injunctive social norms of daily smokers became less antismoking between 2002 and 2015, despite increases around 2006–2007. There was no change over time in the proportion of daily smokers who report that over half of their five closest friends smoke.

2479,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Rescuing Vapers Versus Rescuing Smokers: The Ethics,article," Suppose for the sake of argument that wide access to electronic cigarettes would help a great many smokers quit and others avoid smoking, with a dramatic cumulative effect on population health. But suppose also that nowadays, teenagers rarely benefit from that effect, because most do not smoke and are not expected to smoke as adults. Many teenagers do vape. When the net effect of vaping on general public health is expected to remain very positive, should we nevertheless fight vaping, so as to protect teenagers from the direct risks of vaping? For example, what to do if and when certain targeted regulations that would protect teenagers would also, by making it harder to vape, substantially increase smoking in the general population? This situation may be common, and, by pitting the health interests of the general population against those of teenagers, poses an ethical dilemma. This article argues philosophically that if such tradeoffs between the health interests of adolescents and those of the general population exist, morally it is both permissible and preferable to promote the health of the general population. Implications In the debate about electronic-cigarette based tobacco harm reduction, some disagreements are factual, for example, disagreements about how harmful vaping is to human lungs, and how much the option of vaping helps smokers quit. However, there is also an ethical debate: if tradeoffs between the health interests of adolescents at risk of vaping and those of the general population (driven by those of smokers) exist, who should be prioritized? This article argues that morally it is sometimes, at least, both permissible and preferable to promote the health of the general population over those of adolescents at risk of vaping.

2381,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Support for E-cigarette and Tobacco Control Policies Among Parents of Adolescents,article,"Introduction Parents are essential stakeholders for policy implementation. However, data on parents’ support for e-cigarette- and tobacco-related policies is limited. This study examines parents’ support for five e-cigarette- and tobacco-related policies targeted to prevent youth initiation and exposure to industry marketing practices. Methods Data were from a 2018 nationally representative sample of US parents of 11- to 18-year-old middle and high school students. Weighted adjusted logistic regression models examined correlates of support for policy outcomes, controlling for demographics. Analyses were performed among the full sample (n = 2743) and among current tobacco users (n = 355). Results The majority of parents, including current tobacco users, supported tobacco control efforts to protect adolescents. More than 90% of all parents supported restrictions on e-cigarette marketing to youth and 75% supported a ban on flavored e-cigarette sales. Additionally, more than 80% of all parents supported increasing the age of tobacco product sale to 21, limiting tobacco retailer density near schools, and keeping tobacco products out of view where youth shop. Presence of strict home tobacco rules or reporting a high priority to prevent child’s e-cigarette use were significantly associated with higher odds of policy support. Results were similar among current tobacco users. Conclusions Parents are an important group of tobacco control stakeholders and should be utilized to garner support for tobacco control policies in the context of the recent growth in youth tobacco and e-cigarette use. Parents’ public support for tobacco control policies, particularly regulations on e-cigarette sales and marketing, can motivate advocates and policymakers to advance tobacco control policy agendas. Implications Youth tobacco and e-cigarette use in the United States has increased in recent years. Parents are important stakeholders to inform policy agendas and advance efforts to restrict youth access and exposure to tobacco products. This study provides evidence that parents of adolescents are highly supportive of youth-centered tobacco control policies, particularly those that restrict access to youth-targeted e-cigarette marketing and the sale of youth-appealing flavored e-cigarettes. Utilizing policy support to mobilize parents may be an important advocacy strategy to advance tobacco control policy agendas and curb rising rates of youth e-cigarette and tobacco use.

467,Tobacco Control,2018,"Market-level exposure to state antismoking media campaigns and public support for tobacco control policy in the United States, 2001–2002",Other,"Objective This study tests whether exposure to state antismoking media campaigns is associated with increased support for comprehensive bans on smoking indoors and cigarette advertising. Methods We combine commercially available data on market-level state-sponsored antismoking advertisements with three waves of the Current Population Survey’s Tobacco Use Supplement to test the relationship between market-level volume of state antismoking advertising exposure and support for tobacco control policy between 2001 and 2002. We use logistic regression to assess which message themes employed in the advertisements are associated with increased support for tobacco control policy. Results The overall market-level volume of exposure to state antismoking ads targeted to adults or the general population was associated with significant increases in support for comprehensive indoor smoking bans. These effects were driven by exposure to ads emphasising the health consequences of smoking to others, anti-industry appeals and irrationality/addiction appeals. Evidence of campaign impact on support for tobacco advertising bans was less clear and, when statistically significant, small in magnitude relative to the impact of the state economic and tobacco control policy environment. Conclusions This study shows that that large-scale antismoking media campaigns can have a meaningful secondary impact on support for comprehensive indoor smoking bans. Future research should identify the conditions under which mass media campaigns primarily targeting smoking behaviour may influence public support for a variety of other tobacco control policies. ","Many scholars suggest that a potential impact of mass media antismoking campaigns may be to increase public willingness to support tobacco control policy, but research has yet to parse out the specific impact of these campaigns in shaping public policy support. This study is the first to combine market-level data on state antismoking advertising exposure with a large national sample of US adults between 2001 and 2002 to test whether these campaigns are associated with increased support for tobacco control policy, controlling for demographic factors and other state/national antismoking campaigns, programmes and policies. Results provide the strongest evidence to date that large-scale mass media campaigns targeting adult smokers can have important secondary effects on increasing public support for tobacco control policy, particularly comprehensive indoor smoking bans. We recommend that media campaigns consider emphasising the health consequences of smoking to others, describing negative behaviour of the tobacco industry and discussing the addictive nature of tobacco in efforts to broaden support for comprehensive tobacco control efforts in the USA.

1363,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Adolescents’ and Young Adults’ Knowledge and Beliefs About Constituents in Novel Tobacco Products,article,"Introduction: Novel tobacco products, such as little cigars, cigarillos, hookah, and e-cigarettes, and their smoke or aerosol contain chemicals which the FDA has determined to be Harmful or Potentially Harmful Constituents. We explored adolescents’ and young adults’ knowledge and beliefs about constituents in novel tobacco products and their smoke or aerosol, in order to inform risk communication messages. Methods: Seventy-seven adolescents and young adults (ages 13–25) participated in 10 focus groups, including 47 novel tobacco product users and 30 susceptible nonusers. Participants were asked to discuss 10 pre-selected constituents found in novel tobacco products and their smoke or aerosol. The first author analyzed the discussion for emergent themes. Results: Participants were generally familiar with arsenic, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and nicotine, but unfamiliar with acetaldehyde, acrolein, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanon (NNK), and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN). All participants had negative beliefs about most constituents, although users had positive beliefs about nicotine. “Unfamiliar” constituents were associated with similarly-sounding words (eg, acetaldehyde sounds like acetaminophen), and some participants recognized words in the chemical names of NNK/NNN (eg, “nitro”). “Familiar” constituents were associated with negative health effects and other common products the constituents are found in. All participants wanted more information about the constituents’ health effects, toxicity, and other common products. Most participants were unaware the constituents discussed are in novel tobacco products and their smoke or aerosol. Conclusions: Risk communication messages could capitalize on negative associations with familiar constituents, or attempt to educate about unfamiliar constituents, to discourage novel tobacco product use among adolescents and young adults. Implications: The results of this study have implications for how the FDA and other agencies can communicate about the risks of novel tobacco products to the general public, which will be particularly important once the Deeming Rule is finalized. Our findings suggest it may be effective to capitalize on the public’s negative beliefs about and associations with familiar constituents, or to educate about unfamiliar constituents and their health effects, their concentration and toxicity in novel tobacco products and their smoke or aerosol, and other products they are found in.

1074,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Maternal Smokeless Tobacco Use in Pregnancy and Adverse Health Outcomes in Newborns: A Systematic Review,article,"Background: Perinatal morbidity and mortality are important indicators of maternal health and the future health of the child. Smokeless tobacco (ST) use during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight (LBW), preterm births, stillbirths, and small for gestation age (SGA). This study systematically reviews and summarizes evidence on the association of maternal ST use with these adverse health outcomes in newborns. Methods: Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Lilacs) were searched in July 2013 using appropriate keywords complemented with reference list searching. Observational studies of maternal ST use and these outcomes were considered; LBW, preterm, stillbirth, SGA. A comprehensive assessment of quality and risk of bias in all included studies was performed. RevMan software was used for data analysis. Results are expressed as crude odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Chi-square and I2 tests checked for heterogeneity and quantified inconsistency between results. Results: There were 9 studies (16 reports) included (7 cohort-studies, 1 case-control study, and 1 cross-sectional study). They were clinically and methodologically diverse. Significant associations with ST use were seen in 5/7 studies for LBW, in 3/6 studies for preterm, in all 4 studies for stillbirth and in 1/2 studies assessing SGA. Heterogeneity between results was moderate for LBW (I2 = 44%) and stillbirth (I2 = 52%), and high for preterm (I2 = 87%) and SGA (I2 = 65%). Meta-analysis was considered inappropriate due to risk of bias and confounding. Conclusions: Although most studies show an association between ST use in pregnancy and adverse health effects in newborns, these results may be limited by confounding and bias. Quality observational studies are needed to strengthen this evidence base.

2257,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Changes in Nicotine Metabolite Ratio Among Daily Smokers Receiving Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder,article,"Introduction Alcohol may influence the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), an index of the rate of nicotine metabolism that is associated smoking level and lapses. We examined if NMR changes during alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment and how changes in NMR relate to reductions in drinking. Methods Using an observational design, 22 daily smokers [63.64% male, Mage = 46.77 (11.37)] receiving AUD treatment completed baseline and follow-up appointments 3 weeks apart. At each appointment, daily alcohol and cigarette use, salivary and urinary NMR, nicotine exposure via urinary total nicotine equivalents, and carbon monoxide were assessed. Multilevel models examined the change over time in NMR and its within-person relations with changes in drinks per week. Sex differences were evaluated. Results There were significant reductions in both salivary and urinary NMR over time for men (p = .02; p = .01, respectively) but not for women (p = .54; p = .90, respectively). There were no changes over time in total nicotine equivalents (p = .09), carbon monoxide (p = .44), or cigarette use (p = .44) in either sex. Drinks per week were significantly reduced for men (29.12 drink reduction, p < .001) but not for women (2.28 drink reduction, p = .80); however, within-person changes in drinking were not associated with changes in salivary or urinary NMR (p = .99; p = .19). Conclusions The reduction in alcohol use and NMR in men provides indirect support for alcohol increasing NMR. In contrast, the low baseline drinking and lack of alcohol reduction likely underlie the lack of change in NMR in females. Reasons for NMR reductions during AUD treatment and its effects on smoking require further study. Implications Three weeks of alcohol use disorder treatment among daily smokers coincided with a significant reduction in both alcohol use and NMR for men; however, neither drinking level nor NMR changed for women. The findings indirectly support that heavy drinking increases NMR, which is reversed with reduced drinking. Additional research is needed to establish if these changes in NMR correlate with smoking and cessation outcomes.

This study examined the effect that POS display bans have on smoking prevalence. Methods Data were sourced from Euromonitor International and the WHO MPOWER package for 2007–2014 from 77 countries worldwide. generalised linear models with country and year fixed effects were estimated to analyse the effect of POS display bans on smoking prevalence. Results Having a POS display ban reduced overall adult daily smoking, male smoking and female smoking by about 7%, 6% and 9%, respectively. Conclusions Having a POS display ban is likely to reduce smoking prevalence and generate public health benefits. ","Using aggregated country-level longitudinal data from 77 countries in the world from 2007 to 2014, and a two-way fixed effects model, we found that point-of-sale (POS) display bans significantly reduced daily smoking prevalence among adults. POS displays are associated with increased cigarette purchases. However, evidence on the association between POS display bans and reduced smoking prevalence/cigarette consumption is mixed. Existing studies either presented descriptive statistics or estimated associations between POS display bans and smoking behaviours, and as a result, did not analyse the causal impact of POS display bans on smoking.

167,Tobacco Control,2015,Perceived acceptability of female smoking in China,Research Article,"Background Female smoking prevalence in China is very low but may rise with increased tobacco marketing towards women and changing norms. However, little is known about current perceptions of women smoking in China. Objective This study sought to examine smokers’ and non-smokers’ perceived acceptability of female smoking and how it changed over time in China. Methods Data come from Waves 1 to 3 (2006–2009) of the International Tobacco Control China Survey, a face-to-face cohort survey of approximately 800 adult smokers and 200 non-smokers in each of seven cities in mainland China. Results At Wave 3 (2009), about 38% of smokers and 9% of non-smokers agreed that female smoking is acceptable with women being almost twice as likely to do so as men (67% vs 36% and 11% vs 6%, respectively). In addition to women, smokers who were younger and had more positive perceptions of smoking in general were more likely to say that female smoking is acceptable. This perception significantly increased from Wave 1 (2006) to Wave 3 (2009), as did the perception that smoking is a sign of sophistication, but other general perceptions of smoking did not significantly change between 2006 and 2009. Conclusions Norms against female smoking appear to remain strong in China, but female smoking may be becoming more acceptable. It is important to monitor these perceptions to prevent a rise in female smoking prevalence along with an increase in tobacco-related death and disease among women in China. ","Female smoking prevalence in China has remained very low (2%) and has generally been seen as less socially acceptable than male smoking, which is much more prevalent. There is concern that female smoking will rise in China as norms change and tobacco companies increasingly market towards women, but little data are available on current perceptions of female smoking in China. This study suggests that norms against women smoking remain strong: the majority (two-thirds) of adult men and one-third of adult women do not think that it is acceptable for women to smoke. However, the perception that female smoking is acceptable significantly increased over the 3-year study period. It is therefore important to monitor perceptions of female smoking to prevent a rise in prevalence and the burden of death and disease that would come with it.

3,Tobacco Control,2015,Differential trends in cigarette smoking in the USA: is menthol slowing progress?,Research Article,"Introduction Mentholated cigarettes are at least as dangerous to an individual's health as non-mentholated varieties. The addition of menthol to cigarettes reduces perceived harshness of smoke, which can facilitate initiation. Here, we examine correlates of menthol use, national trends in smoking menthol and non-menthol cigarettes, and brand preferences over time. Methods We estimated menthol cigarette use during 2004–2010 using annual data on persons ≥12 years old from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. We adjusted self-reported menthol status for selected brands that were either exclusively menthol or non-menthol, based on sales data. Data were weighted to provide national estimates. Results Among cigarette smokers, menthol cigarette use was more common among 12–17 year olds (56.7%) and 18–25 year olds (45.0%) than among older persons (range 30.5% to 34.7%). In a multivariable analysis, menthol use was associated with being younger, female and of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity. Among all adolescents, the percentage who smoked non-menthol cigarettes decreased from 2004–2010, while menthol smoking rates remained constant; among all young adults, the percentage who smoked non-menthol cigarettes also declined, while menthol smoking rates increased. The use of Camel menthol and Marlboro menthol increased among adolescent and young adult smokers, particularly non-Hispanic Caucasians, during the study period. Conclusions Young people are heavy consumers of mentholated cigarettes. Progress in reducing youth smoking has likely been attenuated by the sale and marketing of mentholated cigarettes, including emerging varieties of established youth brands. This study should inform the Food and Drug Administration regarding the potential public health impact of a menthol ban. ","This study provides more precision than previous research on the use of mentholated cigarettes among young people. In the multivariable model, menthol use was found to be most likely in 12–15 year olds and 16–17 year olds. The multivariable analysis also controlled for household income, taking socioeconomic status into account. Previous work addressed trends in the percentage of cigarette smokers who smoked menthol cigarettes. This work presents trends in smoking menthol and non-menthol cigarettes among all persons (not just cigarette smokers) in each of the demographic categories examined, permitting the conclusion that non-menthol cigarette use is declining more rapidly than menthol cigarette use. Finally, the paper documents the rise of Camel Menthol and Marlboro Menthol brands among young people, particularly Caucasians and Hispanics. The information presented here should be useful to the US Food and Drug Administration and also to many other countries, where menthol cigarettes are being marketed to young people.

1866,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,"Trends and Racial Disparities in Mono, Dual, and Poly Use of Tobacco Products Among Youth",article,"Introduction We examined racial disparities in mono, dual, and poly use of tobacco products including whether racial disparities changed over time. Methods We analyzed data on high school students from the North Carolina Youth Tobacco Survey collected in 2011, 2013, and 2015. Dual and poly use included use of two and three or more tobacco products, respectively, in the past month. Multinomial regression models assessed racial differences and changes over time in mono, dual, and poly use. Data include product combinations most commonly used by youth from different racial groups. Results In total, 24% (in 2011) and 26% (in 2013 and 2015) of students used tobacco products. No significant changes over time were observed in mono (12%) or dual use (6%). Poly use was 6%, 8%, and 7% in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively. Relative to nonuse of tobacco, White students had a higher relative risk than Blacks for mono use. Whites and Hispanics had a higher relative risk than Blacks for dual and poly use. Observed racial differences in tobacco use did not change over time. Types of tobacco products used varied by year and race. In 2015, e-cigarette was the most commonly used product among mono users from all racial groups. Conclusions Substantial racial variation persists over time in mono and multiple tobacco product use among North Carolina youth, including racial variation in the types of tobacco products used. Research and policy efforts should examine and eliminate factors that drive multiple tobacco use and racial disparities in use among youth. Implications This study reports on racial disparities in mono and multiple tobacco product use among youth. White and Hispanic youth have higher relative risk for dual and poly use of tobacco products than Black youth. In addition, significant racial variation exists in the types of tobacco products used among youth mono, dual, and poly users, with cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and e-cigarettes being the most commonly used products. Patterns of multiple tobacco product use vary by race and may warrant tailored prevention efforts. Strengthening tobacco control regulations for other tobacco products than cigarettes is critical to reduce multiple tobacco product use among youth.

703,Tobacco Control,2019,From glass boxes to social media engagement: an audit of tobacco retail marketing in Indonesia,Research Article,"Objective To assess tobacco promotion intensity, retailer behaviours and tobacco company efforts to link retailer marketing to online channels. Methods We completed an audit of tobacco advertisements and promotions at 1000 randomly selected cigarette retailers in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia that included an observation checklist, digital photos and structured interviews with retailers. We then calculated the tobacco promotion index for each retailer and made comparisons based on store types. Next, we conducted a photo analysis from 100 randomly selected retailers to explore links to online channels and other promotional cues to engage young people. Results Mini-markets have both the highest total number of promotions and the highest indoor promotion index with a mean score of 5.1 and 3.7, respectively. Kiosks have the highest outdoor promotion index with a mean score of 1.6. Most of the retailers (98.9%) displayed cigarettes, more than half of kiosk retailers (54.8%) and mini-market retailers (56.3%) admitted selling cigarettes to young people, and 74% of kiosk retailers sell single stick cigarettes. We found links to online marketing, including two hashtags and a company website. Promotional materials also included youth-focused content such as English taglines, new products and small packs. Conclusion Tobacco companies in Indonesia have strategically differentiated their advertisements based on retailer type and have bridged conventional retailer marketing to online channels. Reforming Indonesian tobacco laws to include bans on single sticks and small pack sales, point-of-sale advertising, including displays, and enforcement of laws on sales to minors is urgently required. ","This paper has documented the strategic efforts made by tobacco companies in Indonesia to differentiate advertising materials between retailers and to link retailer marketing to online, new media channels.

637,Tobacco Control,2019,Secondhand smoke exposure during pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis of data from Demographic and Health Survey from 30 low-income and middle-income countries,Other,"Background Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of infant stillbirth, congenital malformations, low birth weight and respiratory illnesses. However, little is known about the extent of SHS exposure during pregnancy. We assessed the prevalence of SHS exposure in pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We used Demographic and Health Survey data collected between 2008 and 2013 from 30 LMICs. We estimated weighted country-specific prevalence of SHS exposure among 37 427 pregnant women. We accounted for sampling weights, clustering and stratification in the sampling methods. We also explored associations between sociodemographic variables and SHS exposure in pregnant women using pairwise multinomial regression model. Findings The prevalence of daily SHS exposure during pregnancy ranged from 6% (95% CI 5% to 7%) (Nigeria) to 73% (95% CI 62% to 81%) (Armenia) and was greater than active tobacco use in pregnancy across all countries studied. Being wealthier, maternal employment, higher education and urban households were associated with lower SHS exposure in full regression models. SHS exposure in pregnant women closely mirrors WHO Global Adult Tobacco Survey male active smoking patterns. Daily SHS exposure accounted for a greater population attributable fraction of stillbirths than active smoking, ranging from 1% of stillbirths (Nigeria) to 14% (Indonesia). Interpretation We have demonstrated that SHS exposure during pregnancy is far more common than active smoking in LMICs, accounting for more stillbirths than active smoking. Protecting pregnant women from SHS exposure should be a key strategy to improve maternal and child health. ","Three primary research articles are published describing the prevalence of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in pregnancy in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) that focus on 11 countries in total. These papers demonstrate that in the countries studied, maternal exposure to SHS is common, from 17.1% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 91.6% in Pakistan. This represents an emerging problem for LMICs in tackling maternal and child health. Only one research article from Bangladesh provided prevalence data on country-level nationally representative samples. While national prevalence estimates are available for active smoking during pregnancy for many LMICs, such data are not available to describe the prevalence of SHS exposure during pregnancy. This is the first study which provides national estimates for 30 LMICs on SHS exposure in pregnancy and shows that these estimates are much higher than active smoking during pregnancy. For these countries, the estimated population attributable risk due to SHS exposure during pregnancy could be higher than that due to active smoking.

1632,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,"Measuring PM2.5, Ultrafine Particles, Nicotine Air and Wipe Samples Following the Use of Electronic Cigarettes",article,"Background Few studies have examined the extent of inhalation or dermal contact among bystanders following short-term, secondhand e-cigarette exposure. Objective Measure PM2.5 (particles < 2.5 microns), UF (ultrafine particles < 100 nm), and nicotine in air and deposited on surfaces and clothing pre-/during/post- a short-term (2-hour) e-cigarette exposure. Methods E-cigarettes were used ad libitum by three experienced users for 2 hours during two separate sessions (disposable e-cigarettes, then tank-style e-cigarettes, or “tanks”) in a 1858 ft3 room. We recorded: uncorrected PM2.5 (using SidePak); UF (using P-Trak); air nicotine concentrations (using air samplers; SKC XAD-4 canisters); ambient air exchange rate (using an air capture hood). Wipe samples were taken by wiping 100 cm2 room surfaces pre- and post- both sessions, and clean cloth wipes were worn during the exposure and collected at the end. Results Uncorrected PM2.5 and UF were higher (p < .0001) during sessions than before or after. Median PM2.5 during exposure was higher using tanks (0.515 mg/m3) than disposables (0.035 mg/m3) (p < .0001). Median UF during exposure was higher using disposables (31 200 particles/cm3) than tanks (25 200 particles/cm3)(p < .0001). Median air nicotine levels were higher (p < .05) during both sessions (disposables = 0.697 ng/L, tanks = 1.833 ng/L) than before (disposables = 0.004 ng/L, tanks = 0.010 ng/L) or after (disposables = 0.115 ng/L, tanks = 0.147 ng/L). Median accumulation rates of nicotine on surface samples were 2.1 ng/100 cm2/h using disposables and 4.0 ng/100 cm2/h using tanks; for cloth samples, it was 44.4 ng/100 cm2/h using disposables and 69.6 ng/100 cm2/h using tanks (p < .01). Mean room ventilation rate was ~5 air changes per hour during both sessions. Conclusions Short-term e-cigarette use can produce: elevated PM2.5; elevated UF; nicotine in the air; and accumulation of nicotine on surfaces and clothing. Implications Short-term indoor e-cigarette use produced accumulation of nicotine on surfaces and clothing, which could lead to dermal exposure to nicotine. Short-term e-cigarette use produced elevated PM2.5 and ultrafine particles, which could lead to secondhand inhalation of these particles and any chemicals associated with them by bystanders. We measured significant differences in PM2.5 and ultrafine particles between disposable e-cigarettes and tank-style e-cigarettes, suggesting a difference in the exposure profiles of e-cigarette products.

1415,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Nicotine Enhances Footshock- and Lithium Chloride-Conditioned Place Avoidance in Male Rats,article,"Introduction: Numerous studies have shown that nicotine (NIC) can enhance the reinforcing effects of non-NIC stimuli through a nonassociative mechanism. To date, it is unclear whether NIC reinforcement enhancement serves to increase behaviors motivated by rewarding stimuli only, or whether NIC potentiates behavior motivated by all stimuli, regardless of valence. Methods: The current study used a place conditioning procedure to examine whether acute NIC injection modulates avoidance of an environment previously associated with an aversive stimulus. Separate groups of rats underwent place conditioning using either lithium chloride (125mg/kg/ml, i.p.) or footshock (0.75 mA) as the aversive stimulus. Other rats served as nonconditioned controls. The magnitude of place avoidance was assessed after acute NIC (0.1 or 0.4mg/kg/ml, s.c.) or saline. Results: Rats avoided chambers previously paired with either lithium chloride or footshock, and conditioned place avoidance was significantly enhanced by NIC pre-treatment. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the ability of NIC to enhance motivated behavior extends to behaviors elicited by aversive stimuli, evidence that NIC affects behavior motivated by a broader range of stimuli than previously appreciated. Implications: The current study examined whether the reinforcement enhancement properties of NIC apply to aversive stimuli by testing NIC enhancement of conditioned place avoidance in rats. The results demonstrate that NIC enhances the motivational impact of these distinct aversive stimuli, providing novel evidence that NIC affects behavior motivated by a broader range of stimuli than has previously been demonstrated.

1010,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Assessing Preferences for a University-Based Smoking Cessation Program in Lebanon: A Discrete Choice Experiment,article,"Introduction: Smoking prevalence rates in Lebanon are among the highest in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Few smoking cessation programs are offered in Lebanon and little is known about the preferences of Lebanese smokers for cessation treatment programs. Objective: To establish which attributes of smoking cessation programs are most important to Lebanese smokers. Methods: Smokers at the American University of Beirut were surveyed to elicit their preferences for, and tradeoffs between the attributes of a hypothetical university-based smoking cessation program. Preferences for medication type/mechanism, risk of benign side effects, availability of support, distance traveled to obtain medication, and price of complete treatment were assessed using the discrete choice experiment method. Results:  The smokers’ responses ( N = 191) to changes in attributes were statistically significant. Smokers were willing to make trade-offs between attributes. On average, smokers were willing to pay LBP 103,000 (USD 69) for cessation support. Respondents were willing to give up LBP 105,000 (USD 70) to avoid an additional 10% risk of minor side effects and LBP 18,000 (USD 12) to avoid an addition kilometer of travel to the nearest pharmacy. Heavy smokers were the least responsive group and had the lowest demand elasticities.  Conclusions: Student smokers were willing to participate in a relatively complex exercise that weighs the advantages and disadvantages of a hypothetical smoking cessation program. Overall they were less interested in the pill form of smoking cessation treatment, but they were willing to make tradeoffs to be smoke-free.

1799,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Infrequent and Frequent Nondaily Smokers and Daily Smokers: Their Characteristics and Other Tobacco Use Patterns,article,"Introduction The proportion of smokers who do not smoke daily has increased over time, but nondaily smokers are a heterogeneous group. We compare characteristics and other tobacco product use of infrequent nondaily, frequent nondaily, and daily US adult smokers. Methods We analyzed data from the 1998, 2000, 2005, and 2010 National Health Interview Surveys. Current smokers were categorized as daily, infrequent nondaily (smoked 1–12 days in the past 30 days), and frequent nondaily (smoked 13–29 days in the past 30 days) smokers. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the correlates of infrequent nondaily, frequent nondaily, and daily smoking. Results Among current smokers, 8.3% were infrequent nondaily, 8.1% were frequent nondaily, and 83.6% were daily smokers. The prevalence of infrequent versus daily smoking increased over time, with a smaller increase among non-Hispanic Blacks than non-Hispanic Whites. The adjusted odds of both infrequent and frequent smoking versus daily smoking differed by age, race/ethnicity, education, poverty status, marital status, region, quit attempts in the past 12 months, and binge drinking. Snuff users (vs. non-snuff users) were 2.4 times as likely to be infrequent than daily smokers. There were also differences in race/ethnicity, education, marital status, region, quit attempts, and snuff use between infrequent versus frequent smokers. Conclusion Infrequent smokers differ from both frequent and daily smokers in socio-demographics, quit attempts, and snuff use. The heterogeneity of nondaily smokers should be considered in developing targeted tobacco control and smoking cessation programs. Implications Infrequent and frequent nondaily smokers were found to differ from daily smokers in age, race/ethnicity, education, poverty status, marital status, region, and quit attempts and they were different from each other in race/ethnicity, education, marital status, region, and quit attempts. Binge drinkers were more likely to be infrequent smokers and frequent smokers versus daily smokers. Current snuff users were found to have increased odds of infrequent smoking versus daily smoking and versus frequent smoking. These results highlight the importance of acknowledging the differences among nondaily smokers in smoking frequency in developing targeted tobacco control and smoking cessation programs.

2418,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Prospective and Daily Effects of Cannabis Use on Smoking Outcomes During a Self-Guided Quit Attempt,article,"Introduction Past research suggests that cannabis use is a risk factor for relapse in people trying to quit smoking. Most people attempt to quit smoking without any assistance (ie, self-guided quitters), yet no one has examined the association between cannabis use and relapse among self-guided quitters. The current study examines how cannabis use might contribute to poorer smoking outcomes in a sample of self-guided quitters. Aims and Methods Data were taken from a study of unaided smoking cessation in 62 single-smoker couples. Quitters and their Partners completed baseline questionnaires and a 21-day ecological momentary assessment. This article examines Quitters’ and Partners’ past-year cannabis use reported at baseline and daily cannabis use during the ecological momentary assessment as predictors of prospective and daily smoking outcomes. Results We found very little evidence that past-year cannabis use was associated with poorer smoking outcomes. However, Quitters reported greater smoking on days when they or their Partners reported cannabis use. Conclusions This study produced evidence to support daily Quitter and Partner cannabis use as a risk factor for poor smoking outcomes. Smoking cessation programs might benefit from targeting cannabis use as well as taking a couples-oriented approach to treatment. Implications This article examined how cannabis use impacts smoking outcomes in a sample of self-guided quitters using prospective and daily diary analyses. We found very little evidence that past-year cannabis use was associated with poorer smoking outcomes.

940,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Children Learning About Second-Hand Smoking: A Feasibility Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,article,"Background: Exposure to second-hand smoke is a threat to children’s health. We developed a school-based smoke-free intervention (SFI) to support families in implementing smoke-free homes in Bangladesh, and gathered preliminary evidence of its effectiveness. Methods: A feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial of SFI was conducted in 24 schools in Mirpur, an urban area within Dhaka. Using simple stratified randomization, schools were allocated to: Arm A (SFI only), Arm B (SFI plus reminders), and Arm C (the control group). A total of 781 year-5 children (10–12 years old) in the consenting schools, participated in the study. Outcomes including “smoke-free homes” and “social visibility” that is, not smoking in front of children at home were assessed through questionnaire-based children’s surveys, administered by researchers, at baseline and at weeks 1, 12, 27, and 52 in all arms. Results:  “Smoke-free homes” were significantly higher in Arm A (odds ratio [ OR ] = 4.8; 95% CI = 2.6–9.0) and in Arm B ( OR = 3.9; 95% CI = 2.0–7.5) than in Arm C, when controlled for the baseline levels, at year 1. Similarly, “social visibility” was significantly reduced in Arm A ( OR = 5.8; 95% CI = 2.8–11.7) and in Arm B ( OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 3.3–15.9) than Arm C, when controlled for the baseline levels, at year 1. We observed an increasing trend (Cochrane Armitage test statistic [ Z ] = 3.8; p < .0001) in homes becoming smoke-free with increasing intensity of the intervention (control < Arm A < Arm B), and a decreasing trend ( Z = −5.13; p < .0001) in social visibility at homes.  Conclusion: SFI has the potential to encourage children to negotiate a smoke-free environment in their homes.

1962,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Health Care Provider Intervention and Utilization of Cessation Assistance in 12 Low- and Middle-Income Countries,article,"Background and Aim There is a need to improve utilization of cessation assistance in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and tobacco cessation research has been identified as priority in LMICs. This study evaluates the relationship between health care provider intervention and cessation assistance utilization in LMICs. Methods Data from 13 967 participants (aged ≥15 years, 90.3% males) of the Global Adults Tobacco Survey conducted in 12 LMICs (74.3%–97.3% response rates) were analyzed with utilization of counseling/cessation clinic, WHO-recommended medications, and quitline as outcome variables. Health care provider intervention (“no intervention,” only “tobacco screening,” “quit advice”) was the exposure variable. Weighted multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between each outcome variable and the exposure variable, adjusting for other covariates. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Results Approximately 52%, 8%, and 40% of participants received no intervention, only tobacco screening, and advice to quit, respectively. Overall, 0.4%, 1.9%, 3.0%, and 4.5% used quitline, WHO-recommended medications, counseling/cessation clinic, and any cessation assistance, respectively. Compared with no intervention, quit advice was associated with increased utilization of quitline (OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.2 to 4.4), WHO-recommended medications (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.2 to 2.3), counseling/cessation clinic (OR = 4.41, 95% CI = 3.2 to 6.1), and any assistance (any of the three types) (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 2.2 to 3.6). Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that the incorporation of quit advice by health care providers in tobacco control programs and health care systems in LMICs could potentially improve utilization of cessation assistance to improve smoking cessation in LMICs. Implications This first study of association between health care provider intervention and the utilization of cessation assistance in LMICs reports that there was a missed opportunity to provide quit advice to about 60% of smokers who visited a health care provider in the past year. The odds of utilization of counseling/cessation clinic, WHO-recommended medications, and quitline were significantly increased in participants who were advised to quit smoking. The results suggest that effective integration and implementation of advice to quit in tobacco control programs and the national health care systems may increase the use of cessation assistance to quit smoking.

We sought to determine whether demographic shifts occurred among the participants reporting Pall Mall as their usual brand during this time span. Method We examined National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data from 2002–2014. Demographic characteristics included age, education, ethnicity, income, and cigarette use (cigarettes per day, daily/non-daily smoking, and nicotine dependence). We also examined RJ Reynolds investor reports and shareholder documents to determine the impact of tobacco marketing on the growth of Pall Mall. Results Over 2002–2014, Pall Mall has gained among smokers 26 to 34 years of age. More Pall Mall smokers in 2014 report higher incomes (over $75000), and also report lower scores on measures of cigarette dependence, compared to 2002. Pall Mall smokers over time seem to share characteristics of premium cigarette brands smokers. Conclusion The profile of the typical Pall Mall smoker has changed as the brand has gained market share. An association exists between brand positioning and economic forces, which has contributed to an increase in the market share for Pall Mall. Implications It is well known that cigarette marketing drives the sale of tobacco products. The growth in the market share of Pall Mall serves as an excellent example to demonstrate how economic uncertainty paired with brand positioning and advertising worked together to serve as a catalyst for the rapid growth observed for this brand. This paper also looked at various demographic changes that occurred among Pall Mall smokers over a 12 year period and compared them to smokers of all other cigarette brands. The results of this analysis demonstrate the importance of monitoring trends over time among cigarette smokers.

2026,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stop Smoking Interventions in Substance-Use Disorder Populations,article,"Background Tobacco smoking is highly prevalent among people attending treatment for a substance-use disorder (SUD). In the United Kingdom, specialist support to stop smoking is largely delivered by a national network of stop smoking services, and typically comprises of behavioral support delivered by trained practitioners on an individual (one-to-one) or group basis combined with a pharmacological smoking-cessation aid. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions and compare cost-effectiveness for interventions using group- and individual-based support, in populations under treatment for SUD. Methods Economic modeling was used to evaluate the incremental cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) gained for smoking-cessation interventions compared with alternative methods of quitting for the SUD treatment population. Allowance was made for potentially lower abstinence rates in the SUD population. Results The incremental cost-per-QALY gained from quit attempts supported through more frequently provided interventions in England ranged from around £4,700 to £12,200. These values are below the maximum cost-effectiveness threshold adopted by policy makers in England for judging whether health programs are a cost-effective use of resources. The estimated cost-per-QALY gained for interventions using group-based behavioral support were estimated to be at least half the magnitude of those using individual support due to lower intervention costs and higher reported quit rates. Conclusions reached regarding the cost-effectiveness of group-based interventions were also found to be more robust to changes in modeling assumptions. Conclusions Smoking-cessation interventions were found to be cost-effective when applied to the SUD population, particularly when group-based behavioral support is offered alongside pharmacological treatment. Implications This analysis has shown that smoking-cessation interventions combining pharmacological treatment with behavioral support can offer a cost-effective method for increasing rates of smoking cessation in populations being treated for a substance-use disorder. This is despite evidence of lower comparative success rates in terms of smoking abstinence in populations with SUD. Our evaluation suggests that medication combined with group-based behavioral support may offer better value for money in this population compared with interventions using individual support, though further evidence on the comparative effectiveness and cost of interventions delivered to SUD treatment populations would facilitate a more robust comparison.

2053,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Dose-Dependent Effect of Cotinine-Verified Tobacco Smoking on Serum Immunoglobulin E Levels in Korean Adult Males,article,"Background Smoking is one of the risk factors to exacerbate allergic diseases, and it may affect serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. However, few studies have relied on an objective biomarker to examine the effect of tobacco smoking on serum IgE levels. Method A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationship between urinary cotinine (Ucot) concentrations and IgE levels in 973 males using data from the 2010 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Ucot was classified into four groups based on concentration (ng/mL) as follows: nonsmoker group (Ucot <50 ng/mL) and three tertile groups in smokers (T1 [Ucot: 50.00–921.28 ng/mL]; T2 [Ucot: 921.29–1869.36 ng/mL]; and T3 [Ucot ≥1869.37 ng/mL]). The dose-response relationships between Ucot concentrations and total serum IgE level were estimated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and multiple linear regression analysis after adjusting for confounding variables. Results We found a significant and positive dose-related effect of cigarette smoking as measured by Ucot concentrations on the total serum IgE level. The multivariate adjusted means of total serum IgE levels (SE) were 321.0 (36.3), 404.4 (102.7), 499.2 (79.2), and 534.7 (82.7) IU/mL, after adjusting for age, body mass index, alcohol ingestion, physical exercise, job, and household income. The regression coefficient β for total serum IgE was β = 68.6 with increasing level of Ucot group after adjusting for the same covariables (p = .009). Conclusion These findings suggest that the amount of smoking may have a dose-dependent effect on total serum IgE levels. Implication Smoking is one of the risk factors to exacerbate allergic diseases, and it may affect serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, which is closely related to type 1 mediated allergic diseases. However, few studies have relied on an objective biomarker to examine the effect of tobacco smoking on serum IgE levels. We found that tobacco exposure, as measured by Ucot concentrations, increased the serum IgE levels in a dose-response manner in a representative sample of Korean adult males.

1134,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Difference a Decade Makes: Smoking Cessation Counseling and Screening at Pediatric Visits,article,"Introduction: There has been a sharp decline in adolescents who smoke cigarettes but no national-level study evaluating the impact of smoking cessation counseling by pediatricians or other clinicians who care for children. Methods: Combined data from ambulatory portions of the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey and National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1997–1999 and 2009–2011 were analyzed to determine changes in the frequency of pediatric visits that included clinician-reported tobacco counseling and how such counseling varied by child, family, and clinician characteristics. Results:  In 1997–1999, 1.5% of all medical visits for children aged below 19 years included tobacco counseling; this increased to 3.8% in 2009–2011 ( P < .001). A marked increase from 4.1% to 11.1% was noted at well-child visits ( P < .001). There were significant increases in counseling by pediatricians but not mid-level providers or general/family physicians. Provision of counseling did not result in greater visit length during either time point. During 2009–2011, visits with a diagnosis of asthma were four times as likely (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8–6.2) and visits for otitis media two times as likely (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–3.7) to include smoking cessation counseling than sick visits for all other diagnoses.  Conclusion: These results demonstrate a significant increase in tobacco counseling by pediatric providers within the last decade, especially at well-child visits. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation that pediatricians counsel about the harms of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure has not yet been exhaustively implemented. Implications: A significant increase in smoking cessation counseling at pediatric medical appointments, especially at well-child visits, occurred from 2009–2011 compared with 1997–1999, paralleling a large decrease in smoking prevalence. These improvements in counseling rates have been predominantly noted for pediatricians but not mid-level providers or general practitioners. Counseling was not associated with increased visit lengths. Although improved counseling practices by pediatricians have been demonstrated, there is still room for improvement.

2246,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Smoking Decisions: Altered Reinforcement Learning Signals Induced by Nicotine State,article,"Introduction Alterations in dopamine signaling play a key role in reinforcement learning and nicotine addiction, but the relationship between these two processes has not been well characterized. We investigated this relationship in young adult smokers using a combination of behavioral and computational measures of reinforcement learning. Methods We asked moderately dependent smokers to engage in a reinforcement learning task three times: smoking as usual, smoking abstinence, and cigarette consumption. Participants’ trial-to-trial training choices were modeled using a reinforcement learning model that calculates separate learning rates associated with positive and negative prediction errors. Results We found that learning from positive prediction error signals is reduced during smoking abstinence and enhanced following cigarette consumption. By contrast, learning from negative prediction error signals was enhanced during smoking abstinence and reduced following cigarette consumption. Finally, when tested with novel pairs of stimuli, participants were relatively better at selecting the positive feedback predicting stimuli than avoiding the negative feedback predicting stimuli during the smoking as usual session, a pattern that reversed following cigarette consumption. Conclusions These findings provide a specific computational account of altered reinforcement learning induced by smoking state (abstinence and consumption) and may represent a unique target for treatment of nicotine addiction. Implications This study illustrates the potential of computational psychiatry for understanding reinforcement learning deficits associated with substance use disorders in general and nicotine addiction in particular. We found that learning from positive prediction error signals is reduced during smoking abstinence and enhanced following cigarette consumption. By contrast, learning from negative prediction error signals was enhanced during smoking abstinence and reduced following cigarette consumption. By highlighting important computational differences between three states of smoking, these findings hold out promise for integrating experimental, computational, and theoretical analyses of decision-making function together with research on addiction-related disorders.

1944,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Magnitude and Chronicity of Environmental Smoke Exposure Across Infancy and Early Childhood in a Sample of Low-Income Children,article,"Introduction Infants and young children may be at an increased risk for second- and thirdhand exposure to tobacco smoke because of increased respiration rate and exposure to surface residue. However, relatively fewer studies have examined biomarkers of exposure (cotinine) in children under age 4 years. This study examines the magnitude and chronicity of exposure across early childhood among children from low-income families in order to better characterize contextual risk factors associated with exposure. Methods A total of 1292 families were recruited in six nonurban counties of Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Cotinine was assayed from infant saliva at 6, 15, 24, and 48 months of age (N = 1218), and categorized as low (≤0.45 ng/mL), moderate (0.46–12 ng/mL), or high (≥12 ng/mL) at each time point. Categories were highly correlated across time. Latent class analysis was used to summarize patterns of exposure categories across time. Results Magnitude of exposure in this sample was high, with approximately 12% of infants registering cotinine values at least 12 ng/mL, consistent with active smoking in adults. Greater exposure was associated with lower income, less education, more residential instability, and more instability in adult occupants in the home, whereas time spent in center-based day care was associated with lower exposure. Conclusions Young children from low-income, nonurban communities appear to bear a higher burden of secondhand smoke exposure than previous studies have reported. Results contribute to understanding populations at greater risk, as well as specific, potentially malleable, environmental factors that may be examined as direct contributors to exposure. Implications Results suggest that infants from low-income, nonurban families have higher risk for environmental smoke exposure than data from nationally representative samples. Predictors of exposure offer insights into specific factors that may be targeted for risk reduction efforts, specifically conditions of children’s physical space. In addition to considering the increases in risk when an adult smoker lives in a child’s home, families should also attend to the possible risk embedded within the home itself, such as residual smoke from previous occupants. For high-risk children, day care appears to mitigate the magnitude of exposure by providing extended time in a smoke-free environment.

680,Tobacco Control,2019,"Prevalence and characteristics of tobacco purchases in convenience stores: results of a postpurchase intercept survey in Dunedin, New Zealand",Brief Report,"Introduction Arguments regarding the importance of tobacco to convenience stores could impede the adoption of tobacco retail reduction policies. Although trade associations argue tobacco constitutes two-thirds of convenience store sales and drives footfall, few studies have tested these claims. We therefore examined the prevalence and characteristics of tobacco purchases at convenience stores in Dunedin, New Zealand. Methods We conducted a postpurchase survey at 20 convenience stores, each visited for three 60 min intervals over a 4-week period. We used descriptive statistics to determine proportions and 95% CIs of transactions that contained tobacco and those that contained only non-tobacco items. We estimated the mean number of items purchased, the mean number of non-tobacco items purchased and mean expenditure on non-tobacco items. Results Fourteen per cent of transactions contained tobacco (n=95/679); of those, 64% comprised tobacco only. Only 5% of all transactions included both tobacco and non-tobacco products. The mean number of non-tobacco items purchased was 1.9 for transactions containing only non-tobacco products and 1.7 for transactions containing both tobacco and non-tobacco products. After excluding the cost of tobacco, people who purchased tobacco and non-tobacco products spent on average $5.11 on non-tobacco items, whereas people who purchased only non-tobacco items spent on average $6.85. Conclusions Tobacco products constitute a small proportion of items purchased from Dunedin convenience stores and are typically not purchased with non-tobacco items. Our findings are inconsistent with arguments that most small retailers rely on tobacco sales. ","Tobacco companies, and the retail trade associations they fund, have claimed that tobacco is a crucial product for small retail businesses. Few studies have assessed the validity of these claims.

Participants (N=14 379) ages 15–34 were surveyed about JUUL use, tobacco use, electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) harm perceptions, sensation seeking and demographic characteristics. Data were collected February–May 2018. Χ2 analyses assessed differences in JUUL use by demographic and psychosocial characteristics. Logistic regressions identified significant correlates of ever and current JUUL use. Results Overall, 6.0% reported ever JUUL use, and 3.3% reported past 30-day (ie, current) use. Rates were higher among participants aged 15–17 and 18–21 years, with 9.5% and 11.2% reporting ever use, and 6.1% and 7.7% reporting current use, respectively. Among current users aged 15–17 years, 55.8% reported use on 3 or more days in the past month, and over a quarter reported use on 10–30 days. Significant correlates of use included younger age, white race, greater financial comfort, perceptions of ENDS as less harmful than cigarettes, household ENDS use, high sensation seeking and current combustible tobacco use. Conclusion JUUL use was significantly higher among young people, with those under 21 having significantly higher odds of ever and current use. Frequency of use patterns suggest youth may not be experimenting with the device but using it regularly.

This study aimed to identify gender-specific individual and social predictors of cigarette smoking progression among a school-based sample of adolescents in Irbid, Jordan. Methods:  A total of 1781 seventh graders (participation rate 95%) were enrolled and completed an annual self-administered questionnaire from 2008 through 2011. Students who reported “ever-smoking a cigarette” at baseline or in the subsequent follow-up but not being “heavy daily smokers” (>10 cigarettes per day) were eligible for this analysis ( N = 669). Grouped-time survival analyses were used to identify predictors of cigarette smoking progression in boys and girls.  Results: Among the study sample, 38.3% of students increased the frequency and /or amount of cigarette smoking during the 3 years of follow-up. Among individual factors, the urge to smoke in the morning predicted smoking progression for boys and girls. The independent predictors of cigarette smoking progression were friends’ smoking and attending public schools in boys, and siblings’ smoking in girls.

2095,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Smoking and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: A 25-Country Analysis of the Demographic Health Surveys,article,"Background Having HIV/AIDS has been associated with a higher prevalence of smoking. Moreover, evidence suggests that people with HIV/AIDS who smoke have poorer treatment and survival outcomes. The HIV–smoking relationship is understudied in sub-Saharan Africa, where tobacco use patterns and HIV prevalence differ greatly from other world regions. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Demographic Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator Surveys, representing 25 sub-Saharan African countries, were pooled for analysis (n = 286850). The association between cigarette smoking and HIV status was analyzed through hierarchical logistic regression models. This study also examined the relationship between smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and HIV status. Results Smoking prevalence was significantly higher among men who had HIV/AIDS than among men who did not (25.90% vs 16.09%; p < .0001), as was smoking prevalence among women who had HIV/AIDS compared with women who did not (1.15% vs 0.73%; p < .001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the odds of smoking among people who had HIV/AIDS was 1.12 times greater than among people who did not when adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic, and sexual risk factors (adjusted OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04% to 1.21%; p < .001). Similarly, multivariate logistic regression revealed that HIV-positive individuals were 34% more likely to use SLT than HIV-negative individuals (adjusted OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.17% to 1.53%). Conclusion Having HIV was associated with a greater likelihood of smoking cigarettes as well as with using SLT in sub-Saharan Africa. These tobacco use modalities were also associated with male sex and lower socioeconomic status. Implications This study shows that in sub-Saharan Africa, as in more studied world regions, having HIV/AIDS is associated with a higher likelihood of smoking cigarettes when adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and sexual risk factors. This study also supports the literature stating that cigarette smoking is inversely associated with socioeconomic status, as evidenced by higher smoking prevalence among poorer individuals, less educated individuals, and manual and agricultural laborers.

34,Tobacco Control,2015,"Portrayal of tobacco use in prime-time TV dramas: trends and associations with adult cigarette consumption—USA, 1955–2010",Research Article,"Objective Although portrayal of television (TV) and movie tobacco use has been linked with initiation of cigarette smoking in adolescents, its association with smoking in adults has not been assessed. Therefore, we examined long-term and annual changes in tobacco portrayal in popular US TV dramas and their associations with comparable trends in national adult cigarette consumption. Methods Tobacco use in 1838 h of popular US TV dramas was coded from 1955–2010. The long-term trend and annual deviations from trend were studied in relation to comparable trends in adult per capita cigarette consumption using correlational and time-series methods that controlled for other potential predictors. Results TV tobacco portrayal has trended downward since 1955 in line with the historical trend in cigarette consumption. Controlling for changes in cigarette prices and other factors, annual changes of one tobacco instance per episode hour across 2 years of programming were associated with annual change of 38.5 cigarettes per US adult. The decline in TV tobacco portrayal was associated with nearly half the effect of increases in cigarette prices over the study period. Conclusions The correlation between tobacco portrayal in TV dramas and adult cigarette consumption is consistent with well-established effects of exposure to tobacco cues that create craving for cigarettes in adult smokers. Although tobacco use in TV dramas along with movies has declined over time, portrayal of smoking on screen media should be a focus for future adult tobacco control research and policy. ","Portrayal of tobacco use on entertainment TV should be studied because of potential links with adolescent and adult smoking. The literature is unclear regarding the long-term direction of tobacco portrayal on US TV programming. This study covered more years than earlier studies, coded a larger sample, and found that portrayal in popular TV dramas has trended down since 1955 in line with aggregate cigarette consumption. The study also found that annual changes in smoking incidents in popular TV dramas were correlated with US adult cigarette consumption from 1955 to 2010, suggesting that TV portrayals of smoking may have influenced national cigarette consumption. A comparison of the effects of price versus TV portrayal over the period of the study indicated that TV tobacco and its lag may have accounted for a drop in consumption that was nearly half the amount attributable to price. Tobacco control efforts should continue to evaluate the role of tobacco portrayal on entertainment screen media as an influence on adult smoking.

572,Tobacco Control,2018,Impact of modified risk tobacco product claims on beliefs of US adults and adolescents,Research Article,"Objective Under US law, tobacco product marketing may claim lower exposure to chemicals, or lower risk of health harms, only if these claims do not mislead the public. We sought to examine the impact of such marketing claims about potential modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs). Methods Participants were national samples of 4797 adults and 969 adolescent US smokers and non-smokers. We provided information about a potential MRTP (heated tobacco product, electronic cigarette or snus). Experiment 1 stated that the MRTP was as harmful as cigarettes or less harmful (lower risk claim). Experiment 2 stated that the MRTP exposed users to a similar quantity of harmful chemicals as cigarettes or to fewer chemicals (lower exposure claim). Results Claiming lower risk led to lower perceived quantity of chemicals and lower perceived risk among adults and adolescents (all p<0.05, Experiment 1). Among adults, this claim led to higher susceptibility to using the MRTP (p<0.05). Claiming lower exposure led to lower perceived chemical quantity and lower perceived risk (all p<0.05), but had no effect on use susceptibility (Experiment 2). Participants thought that snus exposed users to more chemicals and was less safe to use than heated tobacco products or electronic cigarette MRTPs (Experiments 1 and 2). Discussion Risk and exposure claims acted similarly on MRTP beliefs. Lower exposure claims misled the public to perceive lower perceived risk even though no lower risk claim was explicitly made, which is impermissible under US law. ","The US Tobacco Control Act allows marketing of tobacco products as causing less exposure to harmful chemicals only if this claim does not mislead the public into believing the product presents reduced risk of health harm. Claims of lower exposure and lower risk acted similarly, with both leading to lower perceived quantity of harmful chemicals and lower perceived risk of health harm. Absent concurrent evidence of reduced risk, claims of lower exposure are intrinsically misleading. Claims of lower exposure do not satisfy US legal requirements for modified risk tobacco products.

1910,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Latent Class Analysis of E-cigarette Use Sessions in Their Natural Environments,article,"Background Delivery of nicotine and substances from electronic nicotine delivery systems, or e-cigarettes, depends in part on how users puff on the devices. Little is known about variation in puffing behavior to inform testing protocols or understand whether puffing behaviors result in increased exposure to emissions. Methods We analyzed puff topography data collected using a wireless portable use monitor (wPUM) continuously over 2 weeks among 34 current second-generation e-cigarette users in their everyday lives. For each puff, the wPUM recorded date, time, duration, volume, flow rate, and inter-puff interval. Results We defined use session and classes at the session level using multilevel latent profile analysis, resulting in two session classes and three person types. Session class 1 (“light”) was characterized by 14.7 puffs per session (PPS), low puff volume (59.9 ml), flow rate (28.7 ml/s), and puff duration (202.7 s × 100). Session class 2 (“heavy”) was characterized by 16.7 PPS with a high puff volume (290.9 ml), flow rate (71.5 ml/s), and puff duration (441.1 s × 100). Person class 1 had almost exclusively “light” sessions (98.0%), whereas person class 2 had a majority of “heavy” sessions (60.7%) and person class 3 had a majority of “light” sessions (75.3%) but some “heavy” sessions (24.7%). Conclusion Results suggest there are different session topography patterns among e-cigarette users. Further assessment is needed to determine whether some users have increased exposure to constituents and/or health risks because of e-cigarettes. Implications Our study examines topography characteristics in a users’ natural setting to identify two classes of e-cigarette session behavior and three classes of users. These results suggest that it is important for studies on the health effects of e-cigarettes to take variation in user topography into account. It is crucial to accurately understand the topography profiles of session and user types to determine whether some users are at greater exposure to harmful or potentially harmful constituents and risks from e-cigarettes as they are used by consumers.

1923,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Novel Mineral–Vitamin Treatment for Reduction in Cigarette Smoking: A Fully Blinded Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial,article,"Introduction Many smokers do not achieve abstinence using current smoking cessation options. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated a novel nutritional supplement to assist with quitting smoking. Methods Following a baseline phase where cigarettes per day and nicotine dependence were measured, participants (n = 107) were randomized to placebo (n = 50) or micronutrient conditions (n = 57). A 4-week pre-quit phase permitted titration up to 12 capsules/day. During the quit phase (12 weeks), participants were registered with a public Quitline while consuming micronutrients or placebo. Carbon monoxide levels were measured to confirm smoking cessation. Results Forty-five (42%) participants completed the trial. Treatment and placebo groups did not differ on the primary outcome of continuous abstinence at 12 weeks using intention-to-treat analysis; however, 28% of the micronutrient-treated group had quit versus 18% for placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.71 to 4.48), with number needed to treat = 10. Comparison of cigarette consumption (cigarettes per day) between micronutrient and placebo groups showed that those taking micronutrients reported reduced consumption throughout the trial, notably at pre-quit weeks 1 and 4, and at quit phase week 4. There were no serious adverse events, blinding was successful, and there were no substantive group differences in side effects or dropout rate. Conclusion This is the first RCT investigating the impact of micronutrients on smoking reduction, finding that micronutrients reduced harm through reduction in number of cigarettes smoked relative to placebo. The small sample and high dropout rate limit confidence in the conclusions and generalizability of the study; however, assessed by number needed to treat, micronutrients are comparable to other smoking cessation treatments but with fewer side effects. Future research using larger and longer trials including cost-effectiveness and biomarker measures is encouraged. Implications Micronutrients are being increasingly studied for the treatment of psychiatric conditions, but direct application of micronutrients as a treatment for addictions is novel. There is extensive evidence that micronutrients alleviate stress. Given that tobacco smoking is often used to cope with stress, taking micronutrients may moderate the stress of withdrawal and increase the chance of a successful quit attempt. This study is the first known RCT to investigate the use of micronutrients to support smoking cessation. Treatments that are safe, effective, relatively inexpensive, and readily available are needed and micronutrient supplements offer one such possible alternative.

1949,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Experimental Feasibility Study of a Hybrid Telephone Counseling/Text Messaging Intervention for Post-Discharge Cessation Support Among Hospitalized Smokers in Brazil,article,"Objective Text messaging interventions are effective. Despite high utilization of smartphones, few studies evaluate text messaging for cessation in middle-/lower-income countries. Initiating tobacco treatment in hospitals is an effective but underutilized approach for reaching smokers. We evaluated a hybrid phone counseling/text messaging intervention for supporting cessation among hospitalized smokers in Brazil. Methods We used an experimental design to assess the feasibility and potential effect size of the intervention. Participants (N = 66) were recruited from a university hospital and randomized in a 2:1 ratio into TXT (one session of telephone counseling plus 2 weeks of text messaging; N = 44) or Standard Care control group (N = 22). Participants lost to follow-up were counted as smokers. Results Counselors sent 1186 texts, of which 924 (77.9%) were received by study participants. Participants rated the TXT content as “helpful” (80.4%) and the phone counseling length to be “just right” (95.1%). Although the study was not powered to evaluate abstinence rates, we did observe a higher prevalence of abstinence in the TXT compared to control group at both 1-month follow-up (25.0% vs. 9.1%) and 3-month follow-up (31.8% vs. 9.1%). Carbon monoxide-verified abstinence at month 3 was also higher in TXT (20.5% vs. 4.5%). Conclusions This hybrid telephone/text intervention should progress to full-scale effectiveness testing as it achieved favorable outcomes, was acceptable to participants, and was readily implemented. This type of intervention has strong potential for expanding the reach of hospital-initiated tobacco treatment in middle-/lower-income countries. Implications This study extends research on hospital-initiated smoking cessation by establishing the feasibility of a novel text-messaging approach for post-discharge follow-up. Text messaging is a low-cost alternative to proactive telephone counseling that could help overcome resource barriers in middle- and lower-income countries. This hybrid texting/counseling intervention identified smokers in hospitals, established rapport through a single telephone follow-up, and expanded acceptability and reach of later support by using text-messaging, which is free of charge in this and other low-income countries. The favorable cessation outcomes achieved by the hybrid intervention provide support for a fully powered effectiveness trial.

2281,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Acute Impact of Hatha Yoga on Craving Among Smokers Attempting to Reduce or Quit,article,"Introduction Despite negative effects of smoking, smokers have difficulty quitting, suggesting a need for additional strategies to help them quit. A single-session hatha yoga intervention acutely reduced craving among nicotine-deprived smokers not attempting to reduce or quit, yet it is unknown if it reduces craving among those attempting to change their smoking. Thus, this study tested the efficacy of a single-session hatha yoga intervention for acutely reducing craving among smokers attempting to reduce or quit smoking. Methods Data presented are part of a larger dissertation project. Participants were 55 community-recruited smokers (62% male) motivated to reduce or quit smoking randomized to one session of hatha yoga (n = 25) or wellness control (ie, reading educational materials about healthy lifestyle; n = 30) on their intervention day (ie, the day on which they began to reduce or quit smoking). Participants rated, “I have a desire for a cigarette right now,” on a 7-point Likert scale immediately before and after the intervention. Results After statistically controlling for CO in breath, participant type, age, gender, race, and ethnicity, a significant Time × Condition interaction was found, F(1, 47) = 4.72, p = .035, ηp2 = .09, suggesting craving decreased at a greater rate in the hatha yoga condition relative to the wellness condition. Conclusions Results from this study add to a growing body of research demonstrating the potential clinical utility of hatha yoga as an adjunctive intervention tool for smoking cessation. Implications This is the first known study to test the impact of a single-session hatha yoga intervention on craving among adult smokers attempting to reduce or quit smoking. We found that 30 minutes of hatha yoga produced a greater reduction in craving compared to a 30-minute wellness control condition. This relationship was evident even after statistically accounting for other important variables (eg, gender). Results of this study add to a growing body of literature demonstrating the potential clinical utility of hatha yoga as an adjunctive intervention strategy for smoking cessation.

693,Tobacco Control,2019,Impact of adding and removing warning label messages from cigarette packages on adult smokers’ awareness about the health harms of smoking: findings from the ITC Canada Survey,Research Article,"Introduction Adding messages to cigarette health warning labels (HWLs) about the harms of smoking increases awareness of these health facts, but little is known about the impact of removing messages. This is the first study to directly investigate the impact of adding and removing messages from cigarette HWLs on smokers’ awareness of harms. Methods Data were drawn from nine waves of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Canada Survey, a national representative cohort of adult smokers (n=5863) conducted nearly annually between 2002 and 2013–2014. Two analytical approaches were conducted: generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models estimated adjusted percentages of correct smoking-related health statements at each wave and segmented regression analyses modelled temporal trends in awareness before and after the revisions by measuring the difference in slopes. Results Adding messages to HWLs significantly increased awareness that smoking causes blindness (OR=3.36 (95% CI 2.71 to 4.18); p<0.001; estimated increase of 1.01 million smokers in Canada) and bladder cancer (OR=2.14 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.66), p<0.001; estimated increase of 1.09 million smokers). Adding the warning that nicotine causes addiction did not significantly impact smokers’ awareness. Removing messages was shown to decrease awareness that cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide (OR=0.53 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70), p<0.001; estimated decrease of 342 000 smokers) and smoking causes impotence (p=0.007 for the difference in slopes; estimated decrease of 354 000 smokers). Conclusions Adding messages to HWLs increases smokers’ awareness of health facts, but removing messages decreases awareness. These findings demonstrate the importance of carefully considering the implications of adding and especially removing messages from HWLs and the importance of regularly revising warnings.

1800,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Smoking and Mortality in Eastern Europe: Results From the PrivMort Retrospective Cohort Study of 177 376 Individuals,article,"Background The estimated prevalence of smoking and proportion of deaths due to tobacco in Eastern European countries are among the highest in the world. Existing estimates of mortality attributable to smoking in the region are mostly indirect. The aim of this analysis was to calculate the proportion of tobacco-attributed deaths in three Eastern European countries using individual level cohort data. Methods The PrivMort project established a cohort of relatives of participants in population sample surveys in Russia, Belarus and Hungary. Survey participants provided data on smoking habits and vital statistics of their close relatives between 1982 and 2013. Population attributable risk fractions (PARF) in men (n = 99528) and women (n = 77848) aged 40–79 years were calculated from the prevalence rates of smoking and hazard ratios of mortality for smokers versus non-smokers. Trends in PARF over four 8-year time periods (1982–1989, 1990–1997, 1998–2005, and 2006–2013) were examined. Results In men in the most recent period (2006–2013), the proportions of deaths attributable to tobacco were 23% in Russia, 22% in Belarus, and 22% in Hungary. The respective estimates in women were lower (2%, 2%, and 13%), possibly due to underestimation of smoking prevalence. PARF estimates have declined slightly since the early 1990s in men but increased in women. Conclusions Consistently with existing indirect estimates, our results based on individual level cohort data suggest that over one fifth of all deaths in men aged 40–79 years are attributable to tobacco. While these proportions are lower in women, the increasing trend is a major concern. Implications This is the first large scale, individual-level cohort study that estimated the mortality attributable to tobacco smoking directly in Eastern European population samples. The results confirm previous indirect estimates and show that more than 20% of all deaths in Eastern European men can be attributed to tobacco. The study also confirms the increasing trend in smoking-related deaths among women. These findings emphasize the importance of targeted policy interventions in Eastern European countries.

262,Tobacco Control,2016,"Assessing tobacco marketing receptivity among youth: integrating point of sale marketing, cigarette package branding and branded merchandise",Research Article,"Background As countries prohibit tobacco marketing through traditional channels, marketing at point of sale (PoS) and through tobacco packaging is increasingly important for promoting tobacco consumption. Objectives Assess the validity of a novel marketing receptivity index that considers frequency of PoS exposures, tobacco brand recall and ownership of branded merchandise. Methods Data come from a cross-sectional survey of 3172 secondary school students in Argentina. Questions assessed frequency of going to stores where tobacco is often sold; cued recall of brand names for 3 cigarette packages with brand name removed and ownership of branded merchandise. A four-level marketing receptivity index was derived: low PoS exposure only; high PoS exposure or recall of 1 brand; recall of 2 or more brands; and ownership of branded merchandise. Indicators of marketing receptivity and smoking involvement were regressed on the index, including in adjusted models that controlled for sociodemographics, social influences and sensation seeking. Findings Among never-smokers, the index had independent positive associations with smoking susceptibility (ie, adjusted OR (AOR)2v1=1.66; AOR3v1=1.64; AOR4v1=2.95), willingness to try a specific brand (ie, AOR2v1=1.45; AOR3v1=2.38; AOR4v1=2.20) and positive smoking expectancies (ie, Badj 2v1=0.09; Badj 3v1=0.18; Badj 4v1=0.34). A more marked dose–response independent association was found with current smoking behaviour (ie, AOR2v1=2.47; AOR3v1=3.16; AOR4v1=3.62). Conclusions The marketing receptivity index was associated with important variation in smoking-related perceptions, intentions and behaviour among Argentine adolescents. Future research should determine the predictive validity and generalisability of this measure to other contexts, including the explanatory power gained by integrating cigarette package brand recognition tasks. ","Many studies have found a relationship between marketing receptivity and youth involvement with smoking but none have included brand recognition of masked cigarette packages when assessing marketing receptivity. We assessed whether a novel marketing receptivity index that considers PoS marketing exposures, tobacco brand recall and ownership of branded merchandise was associated with smoking involvement among Argentinean youth. The index was positively associated with smoking susceptibility, positive expectancies and willingness to try a specific brand among never-smokers and current smoking behaviour.

1045,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Declining Prevalence of Tobacco Smoking in Vietnam,article,"Introduction: To supplement limited information on tobacco use in Vietnam, data from a nationally-representative population-based survey was used to estimate the prevalence of smoking among 25–64 year-olds. Methods: This study included 14,706 participants (53.5% females, response proportion 64%) selected by multi-stage stratified cluster sampling. Information was collected using the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to surveillance of risk factors for non-communicable disease (STEPS) questionnaire. Smoking prevalence was estimated with stratification by age, calendar year, and birth year. Results: Prevalence of ever-smoking was 74.9% (men) and 2.6% (women). Male ever-smokers commenced smoking at median age of 19.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 17.0, 21.0) years and smoked median quantities of 10.0 (IQR: 7.0, 20.0) cigarettes/day. Female ever-smokers commenced smoking at median age of 20.0 (IQR: 18.0, 26.0) years and smoked median quantities of 6.0 (IQR: 4.0, 10.0) cigarettes/day. Prevalence has decreased in recent cohorts of men (p = .001), and its inverse association with years of education (p < .001) has strengthened for those born after 1969 (interaction p < .001). At 60 years of age, 53.0% of men who had reached that age were current smokers and they had accumulated median exposures of 39.0 (IQR: 32.0, 42.0) years of smoking and 21.0 (IQR: 11.5, 36.0) pack-years of cigarettes. The proportion of ever-smokers has decreased consistently among successive cohorts of women (p < .001). Conclusions: Smoking prevalence is declining in recent cohorts of men, and continues to decline in successive cohorts of women, possibly in response to anti-tobacco initiatives commencing in the 1990s. Low proportions of quitters mean that Vietnamese smokers accumulate high exposures despite moderate quantities of cigarettes smoked per day.

964,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Cigarette Users’ Interest in Using or Switching to Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems for Smokeless Tobacco for Harm Reduction, Cessation, or Novelty: A Cross-Sectional Survey of US Adults",article,"Introduction: We examined: (a) current (past 30-day) smokers’ interest in using or switching to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or smokeless tobacco for various reasons; (b) correlates of interest in these products; and (c) subgroups of current smokers in relation to interest in these products. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey assessing sociodemographics, tobacco use, interest in ENDS and smokeless tobacco among smokers, and knowledge about ENDS among 2,501US adults recruited through an online consumer panel. We oversampled tobacco users (36.7% current cigarette smokers), ethnic minorities, and southeastern US state residents. Results: On average, participants were more interested in ENDS than smokeless tobacco across all reasons provided. Additionally, they were less interested in either product because of their potential use in places prohibiting smoking or due to curiosity and more interested in reducing health risk or cigarette consumption or to aid in cessation. We documented high rates (27.9%) of misbeliefs about Food and Drug Administration approval of ENDS for cessation, particularly among current smokers (38.5%). Also, 27.2% of current smokers had talked with a health care provider about ENDS, with 18.0% reporting that their provider endorsed ENDS use for cessation. Furthermore, cluster analyses revealed 3 groups distinct in their interest in the products, sociodemographics, and smoking-related characteristics. Conclusions: This study highlights higher interest in ENDS versus smokeless tobacco and greater interest in both for harm reduction and cessation than due to novelty or smoking restrictions. Developing educational campaigns and informing practitioners about caveats around ENDS as cessation or harm reduction aids are critical.

1638,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Depressive Symptoms Predict Current E-Cigarette Use Among College Students in Texas,article,"Introduction No studies have examined the longitudinal relationship between e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms among young adults. The main objective of the current study was to establish a potential bi-directional relationship between e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms among college students in Texas, across a 1 year period of time. Methods A survey of 5445 college students in Texas was conducted with 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. A longitudinal cross-lagged model was used to simultaneously examine the bi-directional relationships between current, or past 30-day, e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms across the three study waves. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) with a cutpoint of ≥ 10 to measure elevated depressive symptoms. Covariates included baseline age, gender, college type (2- or 4-year), and other alternative tobacco products used. Results E-cigarette use did not predict elevated depressive symptoms at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. However, depressive symptoms predicted e-cigarette use at both 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Conclusions The current study indicates that depressive symptoms predict subsequent e-cigarette use and not vice versa. Future studies are needed to replicate current findings and also further establish the mechanisms for causality, which could inform Food and Drug Administration regulatory planning. Implications There has been recent evidence for cross-sectional associations between e-cigarette use and elevated depressive symptoms and mental health problems. There have been no studies examining these associations using longitudinal designs. This study established a temporal relationship, such that elevated depressive symptoms predicted e-cigarette use 6 months later among college students. Future research is needed to establish the mechanisms of association as well as causality.

1204,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,"“Direct Dripping”: A High-Temperature, High-Formaldehyde Emission Electronic Cigarette Use Method",article,"Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) electrically heat and vaporize a liquid solution to produce an inhalable nicotine-containing aerosol. Normally the electrical heater is fed the liquid via an automatic wick system. Some ECIG users, however, elect to directly drip liquid onto an exposed heater coil, reportedly for greater vapor production and throat hit. Use of such “direct drip atomizers” (DDAs) may involve greater exposure to non-nicotine toxicants due to the potentially higher temperatures reached by the coil. In this study we examined nicotine and volatile aldehyde (VA) emissions from one type of DDA under various use scenarios, and measured heater temperature. Methods: Aerosols were machine-generated from an NHALER 510 Atomizer powered by an eGo-T battery (Joyetech), using a common PG-based liquid and a fixed puffing regimen. Inter-drip interval, the number of puffs drawn between replenishing the liquid on the coil, was varied from 2–4 puffs/drip. Total particulate matter, nicotine, and VA yields were quantified. Heater temperature was monitored using an infrared camera. Results: Depending on the condition, VA emissions, including formaldehyde, greatly exceeded values previously reported for conventional ECIGs and combustible cigarettes, both per puff and per unit of nicotine yield. Increasing the inter-drip interval resulted in greater VA emissions, and lower total particulate matter and nicotine yields. Maximum heater coil temperature ranged from 130°C to more than 350°C. Conclusions: Due to the higher temperatures attained, DDAs are inherently likely to produce high toxicant emissions. The diversity of ECIG use methods, including potential off-label methods, should be considered as ECIG regulatory efforts proceed.

67,Tobacco Control,2015,"An evaluation of usage patterns, effectiveness and cost of the national smoking cessation quitline in Thailand",Research Article,"Background Telephone-based smoking cessation services (quitlines) offering counselling for smoking cessation without nicotine replacement therapy may be important components of tobacco control efforts in low and middle income countries, but evaluations in such resource-limited settings are lacking. We aimed to evaluate the usage, effectiveness and cost of the Thailand National Quitline (TNQ). Methods Analysis of retrospective data for callers to the TNQ between 2009 and 2012 and a follow-up survey in 1161 randomly selected callers. Results Between 2009 and 2012 there were 116 862 callers to the TNQ; 36 927 received counselling and at least one follow-up call. Compared with smokers in the general population, callers were younger, more highly educated, more likely to be students, and more likely to smoke cigarettes rather than roll-your-own tobacco. Continuous abstinence rates at 1, 3 and 6 months after calling were 49.9%, 38.0% and 33.1%. The predicted rate at 12 months was 19.54% (95% CI 14.55 to 26.24). Average cost per completed counselling was $31 and the average cost per quitter was $253. Assuming all (and two-thirds) TNQ callers who succeed in quitting would have failed to quit without the assistance of the TNQ, cumulative life years saved (LYS) for the 4-year period were 57 238 (36 733) giving a cost per LYS of $32 (50) (about 7.93 LYS per quitter) and an estimated return on investment over 4 years of 9.01 (5.78). Conclusions A low-cost quitline without nicotine replacement therapy is a promising model for smoking cessation services and likely to offer good value for money in Thailand. ","A low-cost quitline without medication as an adjunct to treatment is a promising model for smoking cessation services in low and middle income countries, and likely to offer good value for money. Return on investment suggested that the Thailand National Quitline (TNQ) would start to become attractive as an investment even in the short run.

807,Tobacco Control,2020,Exposure to tobacco marketing in bars predicts subsequent use of multiple tobacco products among non-tobacco-using college students,Research Article,"Background Due to other marketing restrictions, one venue where tobacco companies concentrate their marketing efforts to reach young adults is bars/nightclubs. Objective This study examined the relationship between exposure to tobacco marketing in bars/nightclubs and number of alternative tobacco/nicotine products used 6 months later among college students. Methods Participants were 1,406 students aged 18–29 years old who reported going to bars or nightclubs at least rarely (M age=21.95; 67% female; 46% non-Hispanic white). Students completed an online survey in fall 2014/spring 2015 (wave 1) and again 6 months later (wave 2). Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to assess the relationship between exposure to three types of marketing at bars/nightclubs at wave 1 (tobacco/nicotine product advertisements; free samples; industry representatives) and number of tobacco products used (range=0–5) at wave 2, controlling for school type (2 year vs 4 year), age, sex, race/ethnicity and frequency of bar visits. An interaction between the number of wave 1 products and each marketing variable was tested. Results Greater exposure to free samples and tobacco industry representatives at bars/nightclubs predicted a greater number of products used 6 months later, but only among wave 1 non-tobacco users and not among tobacco users. Exposure to advertisements at bars/nightclubs did not predict the number of products used 6 months later. Conclusion Tobacco companies claim that marketing is targeted to those who already use the product, not to non-users. However, the current study indicates tobacco marketing in bars and nightclubs may encourage use among non-users and has no influence on current users. ","Adult-only venues such as bars and nightclubs remain increasingly important venues for tobacco companies to reach young adults. This study found that greater exposure to free samples and tobacco industry representatives in bars and nightclubs predicted a greater number of tobacco products used at follow-up, among wave 1 non-users, but with no effect among wave 1 users. Given that the effects of marketing were found only among non-users, this suggests that these venues may be important areas for future regulations to reduce initiation.

1128,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Association Between Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Periodontitis Endpoints Among Nonsmokers,article,"Objective: A systematic review was conducted to summarize the epidemiological evidence on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and prevalent periodontitis endpoints among nonsmokers. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Pro-Quest dissertations, and conference proceedings of a dental research association. We included studies from which prevalence odds ratios (POR) could be extracted for periodontitis determined by examiner measurements of clinical attachment level (CAL) and/or probing pocket depth (PD) or self-report of missing teeth. Studies determined ETS exposure by self-report or biomarker (cotinine) levels. Results:  For studies reporting CAL and/or PD ( n = 6), associations were stronger with cotinine-measured exposure ( n = 3; random effects POR [95% prediction interval] = 1.63 (0.90, 2.96)) than self-reported exposure ( n = 3; random effects POR = 1.15 (0.68, 1.96)). There was no meaningful difference in summary estimate for studies reporting CAL and/or PD endpoint ( n = 6; random effects POR = 1.34 (0.93, 1.94)) as opposed to tooth loss ( n = 2; random effects POR = 1.33 (0.52, 3.40)).  Conclusions: There appears to be a positive association between exposure to ETS and prevalent periodontitis endpoints among nonsmokers, the magnitude of which depended mostly on the method of ETS assessment. Implications: The notoriety of ETS is often discussed in terms of its associations with cancer, chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory illnesses in children. However, very little attention is paid to its association with oral diseases, especially periodontitis. Periodontitis affects a large proportion of the population and is a major cause of tooth loss. This study summarized the epidemiologic association between exposure to ETS and periodontitis among nonsmokers. Although the findings are consistent with a positive association, methodological weaknesses relating to study design, assessment of ETS, periodontitis, and adjustment covariates were highlighted and recommendations for improvement in future studies provided.

1770,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Evidence of the Impact of the truth FinishIt Campaign,article,"Introduction Over the past decade, public education mass media campaigns have been shown to be successful in changing tobacco-related attitudes, intentions, and behaviors among youth and young adults. In 2014, the national truth® campaign re-launched a new phase of the campaign targeted at a broad audience of youth and young adults, aged 15–21, to help end the tobacco epidemic. Methods The study sample for this analysis is drawn from the Truth Longitudinal Cohort (TLC), a probability-based, nationally representative cohort designed to evaluate the relationship between awareness of truth media messages and changes in targeted attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors over time. The sample for this study was limited to those with data at baseline and three subsequent follow-up surveys (n = 7536). Results Logistic regression models indicate that truth ad awareness is significantly associated with increases in targeted anti-tobacco attitudes as well as reduced intentions to smoke over time, holding constant baseline attitudes and intentions. Results also suggest a dose-response relationship in that higher levels of truth ad awareness were significantly associated with higher likelihood of reporting agreement across all five attitudinal constructs: anti-smoking imagery, anti-social smoking sentiment, anti-tobacco social movement, anti-tobacco industry sentiment, and independence. Conclusions Longitudinal results indicate a significant dose-response relationship between awareness of the new phase of the truth campaign and campaign-targeted attitudes and intentions not to smoke among youth and young adults. Implications Findings from this study confirm that a carefully designed anti-tobacco public education campaign aimed at youth and young adults is a key population-level intervention within the context of an expanding tobacco product landscape and a cluttered media environment. As tobacco use patterns shift and new products emerge, evidence-based public education campaigns can play a central role in helping the next generation to reject tobacco. Public education mass media campaigns are a key component to changing tobacco use attitudes and behavior, particularly among youth and young adults.

139,Tobacco Control,2015,Has the introduction of plain packaging with larger graphic health warnings changed adolescents’ perceptions of cigarette packs and brands?,Research Article,"Objective To examine the impact of plain packaging of cigarettes with enhanced graphic health warnings on adolescents’ perceptions of pack image and perceived brand differences. Methods Cross-sectional school-based surveys conducted in 2011 (prior to introduction of new cigarette packaging) and in 2013 (7–12 months afterwards). Students aged 12–17 years (2011 n=6338; 2013 n=5915) indicated whether they had seen a cigarette pack in previous 6 months. Students rated the character of four popular cigarette brands, indicated level of agreement regarding differences between brands in ease of smoking, quitting, addictiveness, harmfulness and look of pack; and indicated positive and negative perceptions of pack image. Changes in responses of students seeing cigarette packs in the previous 6 months (2011: 60%; 2013: 65%) were examined. Results Positive character ratings for each brand reduced significantly between 2011 and 2013. Changes were found for four of five statements reflecting brand differences. Significantly fewer students in 2013 than 2011 agreed that ‘some brands have better looking packs than others’ (2011: 43%; 2013: 25%, p<0.001), with larger decreases found among smokers (interaction p<0.001). Packs were rated less positively and more negatively in 2013 than in 2011 (p<0.001). The decrease in positive image ratings was greater among smokers. Conclusions The introduction of standardised packaging has reduced the appeal of cigarette packs. Further research could determine if continued exposure to standardised packs creates more uncertainty or disagreement regarding brand differences in ease of smoking and quitting, perceived addictiveness and harms. ","Cigarette packs are powerful communication tools with broad reach including to children and adolescents. Experimental and qualitative studies suggest that packaging cigarettes in plain or standardised packs reduces perceived attractiveness of packs and perceived quality of cigarettes and corrects misperceptions about harms among adolescents. However, no study has examined adolescents’ responses to plain packaging of cigarettes in a community where plain packaging is the norm. Seven to 12 months after the introduction of plain packaging of cigarettes with large front-of-pack graphic health warnings in Australia, this study suggests that the appeal of cigarette packs and brands to Australian adolescents had decreased significantly.

1282,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Systematic Review of Smoking Cessation Interventions for Adults in Substance Abuse Treatment or Recovery,article,"Introduction: The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for patients with substance use disorders. The secondary aim was to evaluate impact on substance use treatment outcomes. Methods: Randomized controlled trials involving adult smokers, recently or currently receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment for substance use disorders were reviewed. Databases, grey literature, reference lists, and journals were searched for relevant studies between 1990 and August 2014. Two authors extracted data and assessed quality. The primary outcome was biochemically verified continuous abstinence from smoking at 6 or 12 months, secondary outcomes were biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence (PPA) at 6 or 12 months and substance use outcomes. Heterogeneity between studies precluded pooled analyses of the data. Results: Seventeen of 847 publications were included. Five studies reported significant effects on smoking cessation: (1) nicotine patches improved continuous abstinence at 6 months; (2) nicotine gum improved continuous abstinence at 12 months; (3) counseling, contingency management and relapse prevention improved continuous abstinence at 6 and 12 months; (4) cognitive behavioral therapy, plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), improved PPA at 6 months; and (5) a combination of bupropion, NRT, counseling and contingency management improved PPA at 6 months. Two studies showed some evidence of improved substance use outcomes with the remaining eight studies measuring substance use outcomes showing no difference. Conclusions: NRT, behavioral support, and combination approaches appear to increase smoking abstinence in those treated for substance use disorders.

2077,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Widespread Belief That Organic and Additive-Free Tobacco Products are Less Harmful Than Regular Tobacco Products: Results From the 2017 US Health Information National Trends Survey,article,"Significance US smokers of Natural American Spirit, a brand marketed as “organic” and “additive-free,” are more likely than other cigarette smokers to believe that their brand might be less harmful than other brands. This article (1) describes the prevalence of belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco is less harmful than regular tobacco products in the US population and (2) describes the sociodemographic characteristics of adults who believe tobacco products with these descriptors are less harmful. Methods Data were drawn from the 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a nationally representative survey of US adults. Logistic regression models were used to examine correlates of the belief that “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than regular tobacco products. Results Overall, 26.7% of US adults and 45.3% of adult smokers believe that “organic” tobacco products are less harmful than regular tobacco products. Similarly, 35.2% of US adults and 47.1% of smokers believe that “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful. When examining gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and smoking status, only age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ~0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97, 0.99 for both outcomes) and smoking status (current vs. never smokers, aOR ~1.78, 95% CI 1.03, 3.07 for both outcomes) were correlates of believing that “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco is less harmful than regular tobacco products. Conclusions Belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than other products is widespread. Younger adults and current smokers are most likely to be misinformed by “organic” or “additive-free” tobacco product descriptors. Implications Belief that “organic” and “additive-free” tobacco products are less harmful than other products is widespread among US adults and most prevalent among smokers. Removal of terms that incorrectly imply reduced harm may correct current and future consumers’ misperceptions about the brand.

425,Tobacco Control,2017,Use of electronic cigarettes in smoke-free environments,Research Article,"Background Although most US states prohibit cigarette smoking in public places and worksites, fewer jurisdictions regulate indoor use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Given the dramatic increase in e-cigarette use and concern about its impact on non-users, there is a need to examine the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments and related attitudes and perceptions. Methods Recruited from a nationally representative adult panel (GfK's KnowledgePanel), 952 current users of e-cigarettes completed a cross-sectional online survey in 2014. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to examine the factors associated with ever using e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments. Results Overall, 59.5% of e-cigarette users had vaped where cigarette smoking was not allowed. Young adults (18–29 years) were most likely to do so, 74.2%. The places of first-time use most often mentioned were service venues (bar, restaurant, lounge and club), 30.7%, followed by worksites, 23.5%. Daily e-cigarette users were more likely to have vaped in smoke-free environments than non-daily users (OR=2.08, p=0.012). Only 2.5% of those who used e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments reported negative reactions from other people. Most e-cigarette users did not think e-cigarettes are harmful to themselves or to by-standers, and thus should not be banned where smoking is; those who had used e-cigarettes where smoking is banned were even more likely to hold these views. Conclusions E-cigarette use in smoke-free environments was common, suggesting that most e-cigarette users do not consider smoke-free laws to apply to e-cigarettes. Explicit laws should be considered if jurisdictions want to prohibit e-cigarette use in public places. ","As e-cigarette use increases, a question arises as to whether users consider smoke-free policies applicable to e-cigarettes and thus self-regulate their use in public spaces. This study examined the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free spaces among a nationally representative sample of US e-cigarette users. This study adds the following: Most e-cigarette users in the USA do not consider smoke-free laws applicable to e-cigarettes. This was particularly true of young adults. In order to minimise non-user secondhand exposure to e-cigarette aerosol, laws need to be explicit about restrictions on e-cigarette use.

Methods We analyzed the most recent nationally representative data of adults from the National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) 2012–2013 (n = 60192). State-specific prevalence of lifetime and current hookah use was calculated and mapped. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the association between sociodemographic characteristics, regional differences, and hookah use. Results Among U.S. adults (≥18 years), overall prevalence of lifetime hookah use was 12.3%, while current use was 3.9%. Mapping of state-specific prevalence revealed that the West tended to have higher rates of use, while the South tended to have lower ones. In the adjusted model, we observed that current hookah use was positively associated with younger adults, males, non-Hispanic adults, those with higher education and income statuses, being single, those living in the West, and current cigarette use. Conclusion The prevalence of hookah use varies by state, region, and sociodemographic characteristics among adults. Future research, including longitudinal studies, are needed to identify geographic and sociodemographic characteristics and trends among hookah users, investigate hookah-related health outcomes, and evaluate targeted public health efforts aimed at this emerging threat. Implications This study investigates state-level prevalence, regional differences, and sociodemographic characteristics of hookah use among U.S. adults, using the most recent NATS. Hookah use was positively associated with younger adults and those living in the West. This study adds to the understanding of the geographic and sociodemographic factors underlying hookah use, which can be used to develop much needed evidence-based regulations and programs that are responsive to the needs of different risk groups.

1441,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Is the Effect of Anhedonia on Smoking Cessation Greater for Women Versus Men?,article,"Introduction: Anhedonia has been recognized as a major risk factor for smoking persistence. Potential gender differences in the effect of anhedonia on smoking cessation have not been studied. Using data from a completed clinical trial of maintenance nicotine patch therapy, we hypothesized that gender would moderate the effect of anhedonia on short-term abstinence, such that anhedonic women would be less likely to achieve abstinence. Methods: Participants (N = 525; 50% female, 48.2% Black/African American, average age: 46 years) received 21mg/day nicotine patch and four brief behavior counseling sessions over 8 weeks. Participants were classified at baseline using the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale as anhedonic (scores > 2) or hedonic (scores ≤ 2). Bioverified 7-day point prevalence abstinence was measured at week 8. Using logistic regression analysis, we tested the interaction of anhedonia by gender predicting abstinence, adjusting for age, race, nicotine dependence, and baseline depressive symptomatology. Results: Seventy participants (13%) were classified as anhedonic. Men were more likely to be anhedonic than women (16.6% vs. 10.2%, p = .03). Contrary to our hypothesis, the interaction of anhedonic status (hedonic vs. anhedonic) by gender was nonsignificant (p = .18). There was a main effect of hedonic capacity, such that anhedonia predicted abstinence, odds ratio = 3.24, 95% confidence interval = 1.39–7.51, p = .006. Conclusion: Both male and female anhedonic smokers were more likely to be abstinent, which contrasts with prior research indicating that anhedonia is a risk factor for difficulty quitting. This unexpected finding may be explained by a possible selective benefit of nicotine patch therapy, which has been observed in some studies to have antidepressant effects. Implications: This is the first study to examine whether the association between pretreatment anhedonia and smoking cessation differs by gender. For both women and men, anhedonia was associated with a greater likelihood of abstinence after 8 weeks of treatment with 21mg/day nicotine patch and behavior counseling. Our findings indicate that the association between anhedonia and smoking cessation is not as clear as has been assumed and may depend in part on the type of treatment delivered.

1082,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Response to Transdermal Selegiline Smoking Cessation Therapy and Markers in the 15q24 Chromosomal Region,article,"Introduction: Current treatments for smoking cessation have limited efficacy. A potential pharmaceutical treatment for smoking cessation is selegiline, a selective and irreversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor. A few clinical trials have been carried out using selegiline but the results have been mixed. We sought to determine if genetic markers in cholinergic loci in the 15q24 chromosomal region predict response to smoking cessation therapy with selegiline. Methods: We performed an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the selegiline transdermal system in heavy smokers, with follow-up at weeks 25 and 52. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 15q24 region, which contains the genes for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4, were investigated for association with treatment response. Results: The CHRNB4 promoter SNP rs3813567 was associated with both point prevalence abstinence and post-quit craving. Carriers of the minor C allele treated with selegiline showed lower rates of abstinence and higher levels of craving than selegiline-treated non-carriers, indicating that the rs3813567 C allele adversely affects abstinence in selegiline-treated smokers. This effect was not present among placebo-treated smokers. Selegiline-treated smokers with the CHRNA5 rs680244 GG genotype had lower post-quit craving, and unlike placebo-treated GG-carrying smokers, did not experience a post-quit increase in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Variants in genes encoding cholinergic receptors affect abstinence, craving and mood in selegiline-treated smokers. Selegiline primarily affects dopamine levels in the brain, but cholinergic input affects nicotine-induced dopaminergic activity. These markers may have value in identifying those likely to respond to selegiline for smoking cessation.

38,Tobacco Control,2015,A comparison of alternative methods for measuring cigarette prices,Research Article,"Background Government agencies, public health organisations and tobacco control researchers rely on accurate estimates of cigarette prices for a variety of purposes. Since the 1950s, the Tax Burden on Tobacco (TBOT) has served as the most widely used source of this price data despite its limitations. Purpose This paper compares the prices and collection methods of the TBOT retail-based data and the 2003 and 2006/2007 waves of the population-based Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS). Methods From the TUS-CPS, we constructed multiple state-level measures of cigarette prices, including weighted average prices per pack (based on average prices for single-pack purchases and average prices for carton purchases) and compared these with the weighted average price data reported in the TBOT. We also constructed several measures of tax avoidance from the TUS-CPS self-reported data. Results For the 2003 wave, the average TUS-CPS price was 71 cents per pack less than the average TBOT price; for the 2006/2007 wave, the difference was 47 cents. TUS-CPS and TBOT prices were also significantly different at the state level. However, these differences varied widely by state due to tax avoidance opportunities, such as cross-border purchasing. Conclusions The TUS-CPS can be used to construct valid measures of cigarette prices. Unlike the TBOT, the TUS-CPS captures the effect of price-reducing marketing strategies, as well as tax avoidance practices and non-traditional types of purchasing. Thus, self-reported data like TUS-CPS appear to have advantages over TBOT in estimating the ‘real’ price that smokers face. ","Gathering reliable and valid data on tobacco prices is important for a number of reasons, from providing government agencies accurate data when considering cigarette excise taxes to encouraging changes in smoking behaviour based on increased prices. This paper provides a unique comparison between the widely used retail-based Tax Burden on Tobacco report and the self-report, population-based Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The results discussed in this paper suggest an advantage of self-report population-based data over the retail-based data, as self-report data may reflect tax avoidance strategies such as promotional sales. In addition, this paper can serve as a validity citation for current and future research using similar self-reported populated-based price data in tobacco control analyses. These implications will not only affect research in the USA, where the surveys were conducted, but also globally, particularly in countries where self-reported price data are the most practical data to collect and often the only data available.

423,Tobacco Control,2017,Support for e-cigarette policies: a survey of smokers and ex-smokers in Great Britain,Research Article,"Introduction E-cigarette regulations are the topic of extensive debate. Approaches vary worldwide, and limited evidence is available on public support for specific policies or what influences support. The present study aimed to assess smokers' and ex-smokers' support for 3 e-cigarette policies: (1) equal or higher availability relative to cigarettes, (2) advertising, (3) use in smoke-free places, and to assess changes in support over time and associations with respondent characteristics. Methods Smokers and ex-smokers (n=1848) provided 3279 observations over 2 waves (2013 and 2014) of a longitudinal web-based survey in Great Britain. Multivariable logistic regressions fitted using generalised estimating equations assessed change in policy support over time, and associations between support and demographics (age, gender and income), smoking and e-cigarette use status, nicotine knowledge and perceived relative harm. Results Equal or higher relative availability was supported by 79% in 2013 and 76% in 2014; advertising by 66% and 56%, respectively; neither change was significant in adjusted analyses. Support for use in smoke-free places decreased significantly from 55% to 45%. Compared with ex-smokers, smokers were more likely to support advertising and use in smoke-free places. Respondents using e-cigarettes, those who perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes, and those with more accurate knowledge about nicotine were more likely to support all 3 policies. Conclusions Less restrictive e-cigarette policies were more likely to be supported by e-cigarette users, and respondents who perceived e-cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes, or knew that nicotine was not a main cause of harm to health. ","This study shows the level of support among smokers and ex-smokers in Great Britain for equal or greater availability of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes, allowing e-cigarette advertising and use in smoke-free places. Support for prohibiting e-cigarette use in smoke-free places increased, and in 2014, very similar proportions (over 40%) supported and opposed a ban. To a lesser extent, support for banning advertising also increased over the study period. Equal or higher availability relative to cigarettes was more likely to be supported by e-cigarette users, those who perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes, and those who knew that most of the health harms of smoking are not due to nicotine. Less restrictive policies for advertising and use in smoke-free places were more likely to be supported by smokers, e-cigarette users, those who perceived e-cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes and those who knew that only a small portion of the health harms of smoking are due to nicotine. These survey findings suggest that, in addition to smoking and e-cigarette use status, accurate knowledge about nicotine and perception of harm are determinants of policy support.

639,Tobacco Control,2019,"Tax harmonisation and tobacco product prices in the European Union, 2004–2015",Other,"Objectives The European Commission has formally opened a process of revision of its tobacco tax directive. The purpose of this study is to analyse the evolution of cigarette and roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco prices in order to identify avenues for the improvement of public health goals. Methods Pooled cross-sectional data on prices and taxes on cigarettes and RYO tobacco in the Member States over 2004–2015 is used to track the distributions of the most popular price category and the weighted average price of these products and to relate them to the underlying tax structure. Results The inflation-adjusted prices for the two products have increased over the period, but the dispersion of prices across Member States has remained constant. Throughout the period, there was a pervasive price gap between cigarettes and RYO tobacco within the Member States. Such features are explained by the underlying tax design. Discussion The current tax stance has been successful at increasing both cigarette and RYO tobacco prices. To further enhance the public health impact of the European Union tax directive, the revision should promote the convergence of prices across Member States and aim at closing the price gap between cigarettes and RYO tobacco. These objectives call for increasing the mandatory minimum levels of excise duty on the two products, preferably linking them to the evolution of a European weighted average price. The pace of increase should be faster for RYO tobacco in order to close the gap with respect to cigarette prices. ",The European Union (EU) provides a blueprint for regional tax harmonisation and integration. This paper is the first independent study to track the evolution of cigarette and roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco prices and their relationship to taxes under the current tax directive. We expose two important shortcomings from the point of view of public health that can be traced back to the underlying tax design: (1) a lack of convergence in the prices of these two tobacco products across Member States and (2) a pervasive gap in the price of the two products within Member States that gives an unjustified advantage to RYO tobacco. We propose changes to the EU tax directive that may correct these defects and are compatible with the inherently complex process of international tax harmonisation. ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054342,The European Union (EU) provides a blueprint for regional tax harmonisation and integration.

More than one in eight males in the 12th grade are current users of smokeless tobacco. Surveillance data examining nicotine levels of smokeless tobacco subsequent to 2006 have not been reported in the literature. Methods Data on nicotine levels and design features (eg, pH, moisture content, leaf cut and flavour) of smokeless tobacco products sold in Massachusetts were obtained from manufacturers between 2003 and 2012. Design features, levels and temporal trends in unionised (free) nicotine and nicotine content of smokeless tobacco products were analysed overall and by manufacturer and product type. Results The annual total number of moist snuff products increased from 99 in 2003 to 127 in 2012. The annual total number of reported snus products increased from 4 in 2003 to the highest level of 62 in 2011, before decreasing to 26 in 2012. Overall, mean unionised (free) nicotine remained relatively stable (β=0.018 (95% CI −0.014 to 0.050) mg/g dry weight/year) from 2003 to 2012. However, both levels and temporal trends of mean free nicotine varied significantly among manufacturers (p<0.001). Since 2003, the free nicotine content of snus has increased at an overall rate of 0.192 (95% CI 0.138 to 0.246) mg/g dry weight/year, but varied by manufacturer (p<0.001). Conclusions The number of smokeless tobacco products increased in the Massachusetts market. Further, mean unionised (free) nicotine levels in smokeless tobacco products of several manufacturers continued to rise despite decreasing levels from other manufacturers. The current success in tobacco control is very likely undermined without government surveillance, regulation and widespread public disclosure of nicotine levels in these products.

62,Tobacco Control,2015,Determinants and prevalence of e-cigarette use throughout the European Union: a secondary analysis of 26 566 youth and adults from 27 Countries,Research Article,"Objective This study assessed the prevalence and determinants of e-cigarette use among persons aged ≥15 years in 27 European Union (EU) member countries during 2012. Methods The 2012 Eurobarometer 385 (77.1) survey was analysed for n=26 566 respondents. Knowledge, perception of harm, and determinants of e-cigarettes use were assessed, while separate regression analyses among current (n=7352) and former cigarette smokers (n=5782) were performed. National estimates of the number of e-cigarette users were also extrapolated. Results 20.3% of current smokers, 4.7% of ex-smokers, and 1.2% of never cigarette smokers in the EU reported having ever used an e-cigarette (overall approximately 29.3 million adults). Among smokers, ever e-cigarette use was more likely among 15–24-year-olds (aOR 3.13, 95% CI 2.22 to 4.54) and 25–39-year-olds (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.78) in comparison to older smokers, and among those who smoked 6–10 cigarettes/day (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.13) or 11–20 cigarettes/day (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.81) in comparison to very light smokers (≤5 cigarettes/day). Moreover, e-cigarette use was more likely among smokers who had made a past year quit attempt (aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.58). E-cigarette use among ex-smokers was associated only with the respondents’ age, with younger ex-smokers being more likely to have ever used an e-cigarette. Conclusions A substantial number of EU adults have ever used e-cigarettes. Ever users were more likely to be younger, current smokers, or past-year quit attempters. These findings underscore the need to evaluate the potential long term impact of e-cigarette use on consumer health, cessation and nicotine addiction and formulate a European framework for e-cigarette regulation within the revised EU Tobacco Product Directive. ","Despite the controversy that surrounds the promotion of e-cigarettes as a modified risk tobacco product, very limited research spanning the European Union (EU) exists that could provide a base for regulatory actions, especially in light of the revised EU Tobacco Products Directive. E-cigarette ever use among smokers was more likely among 15–24 years olds in comparison to older smokers, and among those who smoked 6–10+ cigarettes/day in comparison to very light smokers (≤5 cigarettes/day). Similar age trends were noted among ex-smokers. Being unaware of the harmfulness of e-cigarettes was associated with a smaller likelihood of having used an e-cigarette, indicating that the lack of scientific knowledge may be a hindrance in e-cigarette use. On the other hand, having attempted to quit smoking in the past was significantly associated with increased odds of having reported ever e-cigarette use/experimentation, identifying the fact that the public may perceive e-cigarettes to have a role in smoking cessation.

1321,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Smoking Behaviors and Attitudes Among Clients and Staff at New York Addiction Treatment Programs Following a Smoking Ban: Findings After 5 Years,article,"Introduction: Addiction treatment clients are more likely to die of tobacco-related diseases than of alcohol or illicit drug-related causes. We aimed to assess smoking behavior, and smoking-related attitudes and services, in New York addiction treatment programs before a statewide smoking ban in treatment facilities was implemented (2008), 1 year (2009) and 5 years after implementation (2013). Methods:  We conducted surveys at each time point with clients ( N = 329, 341, and 353, respectively) and staff ( N = 202, 203, and 166, respectively) from five residential and two methadone maintenance programs in New York State. At each data collection wave, questionnaires measured smoking behavior as well as smoking-related knowledge, attitudes, and experiences with tobacco cessation services as part of addiction treatment.  Results:  Staff smoking prevalence decreased from 35.2% in 2008 to 21.8% in 2013 ( P = .005) while client smoking prevalence over the same period was unchanged (68.1% vs. 66.0%, P = .564). Among clients who smoked, mean cigarettes per day decreased from 13.7 ( SD = 8.38) to 10.2 ( SD = 4.44; P < .001). There were significant time-by-treatment-type interactions for client tobacco-related attitudes and cessation services received; and for staff self-efficacy and cessation services provided. In residential programs, scores for most items decreased (became less positive) in 2009 followed by a partial rebound in 2013. Methadone program scores tended to rise (become more positive) throughout the study period.  Conclusions: Staff and clients may respond differentially to tobacco-free policies depending on type of treatment program, and this finding may help to inform the implementation of tobacco-free policies in other statewide addiction treatment systems.

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and demographic characteristics of U.S. adult smokers who tried to reduce to quit, and the relationship between reducing and successful quitting. Methods: Data came from 12,571 adults in the 2010–2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey who tried to quit smoking in the past year. Frequencies and percentages were used to assess prevalence of reducing to quit; bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess correlates of reducing to quit and successful past year cessation. Analyses were conducted in SAS-callable SUDAAN. Results:  Among adults who tried to quit smoking in the past year, 43.0% ( n = 5,444) tried reducing to quit. Compared to those who tried to quit without reducing consumption, those reducing to quit had a significantly higher prevalence of using counseling or medication (40.2% vs. 25.0%). In adjusted multivariable models, females (vs. males), Blacks (vs. Whites), current some day smokers (vs. every day smokers), and those who used counseling or medication had greater odds of trying to reduce to quit. Reducing to quit was negatively associated with successful past-year quitting ( AOR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.48, 0.72).  Conclusion: Reducing to quit is a common cessation strategy and, in these analyses, was associated with lower cessation success rates. More research on reducing to quit in a real-world setting is needed before widely recommending it as a cessation strategy.

99,Tobacco Control,2015,A gift and a burden: the purchase and distribution of duty-free tobacco and its potential impact upon Pacific people in New Zealand,Research Article,"Background High smoking rates among Pacific people living within New Zealand (26.9%) are a significant and poorly understood problem. A proposed approach to tobacco control is to enhance restrictions on or ban duty-free sales, a pertinent notion for Pacific people given their frequent travel between New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. This study examines the purchase and distribution of duty-free tobacco by Pacific people, whether it is being used as a strategy to circumvent the tobacco excise tax increases and how duty-free cigarette sales are perceived within the Pacific community. Methods We undertook a qualitative research study using six focus groups with Pacific smokers and non-smokers aged between 18 and 54 years. Half of the focus groups consisted of smokers and half non-smokers. We used a thematic analysis approach to identify, explore and report key themes within the data. Results Pacific smokers and non-smokers frequently purchase duty-free tobacco when travelling, and the usage of duty-free cigarettes for gift giving is a strongly embedded cultural value for Pacific peoples. However, nearly all participants strongly supported a proposal to reduce or ban duty-free tobacco sales. Conclusions The findings suggest a ban on duty-free sales could be an important measure to help achieve the smokefree 2025 goal among Pacific communities in New Zealand. This measure would eliminate duty-free tobacco as a cheap form of supply, and efforts to denormalise the practice of gifting duty-free tobacco among Pacific people may also be helpful in reducing high prevalence rates within these communities. ","Our qualitative study found that Pacific smokers and non-smokers frequently purchase duty-free tobacco when travelling for personal consumption, but also as a form of gifting or cultural exchange. This practice enabled them to facilitate relationships and kinship connections, as well as fulfil obligations or expectations from family members. While most were aware of the harms associated with tobacco and smoking, these cultural and social obligations somewhat enabled participants to absolve themselves from responsibility, maintain their identity and social status within a group, and rationalise the regret they subsequently experienced. Nearly all participants strongly supported a proposal to reduce or ban the purchase of duty-free tobacco when travelling, a measure that would remove the temptation and ability to purchase tobacco, and eliminate duty-free tobacco as a form of supply for Pacific communities. Although this finding requires wider testing, it represents a straightforward policy response to contribute towards reducing Pacific smoking rates and achieving the New Zealand government stated goal of a Smokefree Aotearoa by the year 2025.

In this region, it is culturally more acceptable for young people to smoke waterpipe than cigarettes. In fact, sharing waterpipe with family members is often how WTS is initiated among the young9-11. In most EMR countries, prevalence rates of WTS are slightly higher in boys. The gender gap in prevalence rates is much larger, however, for cigarette smoking12,13. Such gender differences were attributed to the social acceptability of WTS, especially among girls, compared to cigarette smoking14.

788,Tobacco Control,2020,Higher negative emotions in response to cigarette pictorial warning labels predict higher quit intentions among smokers,Research Article,"Background Cigarette pictorial warning labels (PWLs) could produce stronger quit intentions than text-only warning labels (TWLs) due to greater emotional arousal. Yet, it remains unclear whether PWLs that elicit different levels of emotions produce different outcomes. To better understand the role of negative emotions in the effects of PWLs, this study developed two sets of PWLs arousing different emotional levels (high vs low) but equally high on informativeness and compared them to each other and to the current TWLs. Methods Adult US smokers (n=1503) were randomised to view nine high-emotion-arousing or low-emotion-arousing PWLs or TWLs. After each label, participants reported the negative emotions they felt while looking at the label. After seeing all the labels, participants reported their intentions to quit smoking. Mediation analyses tested whether message condition influenced quit intentions indirectly through negative emotions. Results Compared with TWLs, PWLs produced higher levels of negative emotions (b=0.27, SE=0.04, p<0.001). Compared with low-emotion arousing PWLs, high-emotion-arousing PWLs produced higher levels of negative emotions (b=0.24, SE=0.07, p<0.001). Higher negative emotions predicted stronger quit intentions (b=0.20, SE=0.03, p<0.001). Negative emotions mediated the effects of PWLs versus TWLs and high-emotion-arousing versus low- emotion-arousing PWLs on quit intentions. Conclusions The results provide additional evidence for negative emotions as the mechanism through which PWLs motivate smokers to consider quitting. The findings call on the Food and Drug Administration to design and implement high-emotion-arousing cigarette warning labels. ","Negative emotions evoked by pictorial warning labels (PWLs) are highly correlated with perceived label informativeness, which may confound the understanding of the role of emotions in processing PWLs. This study extended prior work on PWLs by differentiating between high-emotion-arousing and low-emotion-arousing PWLs while keeping the levels of perceived informativeness consistently high. Controlling for perceived informativeness, high-emotion-arousing PWLs evoked more negative emotions and, in turn, higher quit intentions than low emotion-arousing PWLs.

1730,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Nicotine Sales to Minors: Store-Level Comparison of E-Cigarette Versus Cigarette Violation Rates,article,"Introduction In recent years, e-cigarettes overtook cigarettes as the leading tobacco product used by US adolescents. Most states, as well as federal regulations, have added e-cigarettes to laws prohibiting tobacco products sales to minors. We tested compliance with the newer regulation among Colorado urban retail businesses, speculating that violations might be more common for e-cigarettes than smokable cigarettes. Methods Supervised minors visited a random sample of urban businesses and sequentially attempted to purchase an e-cigarette product and cigarettes. The protocol prescribed that the same minor make both attempts in each business, separated by at least a day to minimize influence of the first result on the second result. Data were collected during May 2014–January 2015. Results Among 238 businesses, more than one-fourth (26.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 18.9%–33.2%) sold at least one type of product, and 6.3% (CI, 1.8%–10.8%) sold both types. Violation rates were similar for e-cigarette products and cigarettes (17.6% vs. 14.7%, p = n.s.). Conclusion Enforcement to prevent retail tobacco sales to adolescents should include e-cigarette products. Dual testing of stores indicates that single visits underestimate the problem of underage tobacco sales. Implications Adolescents can buy e-cigarettes from retail stores as easily as they buy cigarettes. Enforcement of tobacco sales laws should include e-cigarettes, and test–retest protocols are needed to estimate the true extent of the problem.

991,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Sex Differences in Acute Relief of Abstinence-Induced Withdrawal and Negative Affect due to Nicotine Content in Cigarettes,article,"Introduction: Acute cigarette smoking may relieve withdrawal and negative affect due to tobacco abstinence to a greater extent in women versus men. Yet, the relative contribution of the cigarette’s nicotine content to this sex difference is not clear. Methods: Non-quitting dependent adult smokers (N = 44; 21 males, 23 females) participated in 2 virtually identical sessions, each after abstaining overnight (CO < 10 ppm) and differing only in the nicotine content of the designated cigarette. While blind to brand markings, they consumed a total of 24 puffs in controlled fashion for 2hr in each session, either from a nicotine (Quest 1, 0.6mg) or denicotinized (Quest 3, 0.05mg) cigarette. Withdrawal symptoms were obtained before and after smoking, and negative affect was assessed after each period of cigarette exposure consisting of 6 puffs every 25min. Results: Men and women did not differ in baseline withdrawal and negative affect due to overnight abstinence, but reductions in each symptom were significantly influenced by the interaction of sex × nicotine/denicotinized cigarette (both p < .05). In men, but not in women, each symptom was generally decreased more by the nicotine versus denicotinized cigarette, and the nicotine cigarette reduced each to a greater degree in men versus women. Conclusions: Sex differences in relief of abstinence-induced withdrawal and negative affect due to the nicotine content in cigarettes are consistent with prior research indicating that nicotine per se, compared to non-nicotine smoke stimuli, is less rewarding in women versus men.

2020,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Distress Intolerance and Smoking Topography in the Context of a Biological Challenge,article,"Introduction Distress intolerance (DI), one’s perceived or behavioral incapacity to withstand distress, is implicated in psychopathology and smoking. This study evaluated the effect of DI on smoking reinforcement in the context of a carbon dioxide (CO2) biological challenge. Methods Adult daily smokers (n = 90; 48.9% female) were randomized to receive a single inhalation/breath of 35% CO2-enriched air (n = 45) or compressed room air (n = 45). Perceived DI was assessed before the challenge. Smoking reinforcement was examined via average post-challenge puff volume across puffs and at the puff-to-puff level. Results Higher DI was associated with an increased average puff volume (b = −4.7, p = .031). CO2 produced decreased average puff volume compared with room air (b = −7.7, p = .018). There was a DI* condition interaction (ƒ2 = 0.02), such that CO2 decreased average puff volume compared with room air in smokers with higher DI (b = −13.9, t = −3.06, p = .003), but not lower DI. At the puff-to-puff level, there was a significant interaction between DI, condition, and cubic time (b = 0.0003, p =. 037). Specifically, room air produced large initial puff volumes that decreased from puff to puff over the cigarette for high- and low-DI smokers. CO2 produced persistent flat volumes from puff to puff over the cigarette for higher DI smokers, whereas CO2 produced puff volumes like that of room air in lower DI smokers. Discussion Findings suggest DI heightens smoking reinforcement generally, and in the context of intense cardiorespiratory distress, is associated with stable and persistent smoking. DI is a promising therapeutic target that, if addressed through psychological intervention, may improve cessation outcomes by decreasing smoking reinforcement. Implications This study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between DI and smoking reinforcement, via examining these processes in response to acute cardiorespiratory distress. Specifically, we found that smokers who are less tolerant of distress, as opposed to those who are more tolerant, evince a decrease in average puff volume, and consistently low puff-to-puff volume, in response to a biological stressor. These findings suggest that smokers high in DI alter smoking behavior following acute cardiorespiratory distress, perhaps to reduce overstimulation, yet also persist in smoking in a manner that suggests an inability to achieve satiation.

285,Tobacco Control,2016,Smoke-free legislation reduces hospital admissions for childhood lower respiratory tract infection,Research Article,"Background Previous studies showed reduction of hospital admissions for asthma after implementation of comprehensive smoke-free legislation. We aimed to evaluate the impact of comprehensive smoke-free legislation implemented in Hong Kong in 2007 on hospital admissions for childhood lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Methods We obtained data on 75 870 hospital admissions for LRTI among children ≤18 years of age between January 2004 and December 2012 from all Hospital Authority hospitals. Using a negative binomial regression model, we assessed the impact of smoke-free legislation on admission counts. Results After legislation implementation, there was an immediate effect with a change in the admission count of −33.5% (95% CI −36.4% to −30.5%), and a change in time trend to −13.9% per year (95% CI −16.0% to −11.7%). Overall, the legislation was associated with a net 47.4% reduction in admission counts in the first year. We estimated that the legislation was associated with a reduction of 13 635 admissions in the first 6 years after implementation. The immediate reduction and change in time trend was more apparent among school-age than preschool children. Conclusions Implementation of comprehensive smoke-free legislation was associated with a significant reduction in hospital admissions for childhood LRTI. ","The association of the smoke-free legislation effect on asthma admission is shown in previous studies but its effects on other respiratory outcomes are uncertain. One notable example is lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), which is an important cause of death in children globally. The evidences for the harmful effects of air pollution, notably particulate matter, ozone on LRTI, are also only emerging. Our study demonstrates the smoke-free legislation effect on reducing children LRTI admission with immediate and sustainable effect. Overall, the legislation was associated with a net 47.4% reduction in the admission count of LRTI in children aged <18 years in the first year after the implementation of smoke-free legislation. The study result also demonstrates the harmful effects of nitrogen dioxide in addition to particulate matter and ozone on LRTI admission in children.

149,Tobacco Control,2015,"The use of legal, illegal and roll-your-own cigarettes to increasing tobacco excise taxes and comprehensive tobacco control policies: findings from the ITC Uruguay Survey",Research Article,"Background Little research has been done to examine whether smokers switch to illegal or roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes in response to a change in their relative price. Objective This paper explores how relative prices between three cigarette forms (manufactured legal, manufactured illegal and RYO cigarettes) are associated with the choice of one form over another after controlling for covariates, including sociodemographic characteristics, smokers’ exposure to antismoking messaging, health warning labels and tobacco marketing. Methods Generalised estimating equations were employed to analyse the association between the price ratio of two different cigarette forms and the usage of one form over the other. Findings A 10% increase in the relative price ratio of legal to RYO cigarettes is associated with a 4.6% increase in the probability of consuming RYO cigarettes over manufactured legal cigarettes (p≤0.05). In addition, more exposure to antismoking messaging is associated with a lower odds of choosing RYO cigarettes over manufactured legal cigarettes (p≤0.05). Non-significant associations exist between the manufactured illegal to legal cigarette price ratios and choosing manufactured illegal cigarettes, suggesting that smokers do not switch to manufactured illegal cigarettes as prices of legal ones increase. However, these non-significant findings may be due to lack of variation in the price ratio measures. To improve the effectiveness of increased taxes and prices in reducing smoking, policymakers need to narrow price variability in the tobacco market. Moreover, increasing antismoking messaging reduces tax avoidance in the form of switching to cheaper RYO cigarettes in Uruguay. ","Using Uruguay data, this paper provides evidence on substitution between manufactured legal, manufactured illegal and roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes in response to changes in their relative prices. A 10% increase in the relative price ratio of manufactured legal to RYO cigarettes is associated with a 4.6% increase in the probability of consuming RYO cigarettes over manufactured legal cigarettes.

912,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"E-Cigarette Market Trends in Traditional U.S. Retail Channels, 2012–2013",article,"Introduction: E-cigarette sales continue to increase in the United States. To date, little surveillance research has documented the specific product attributes driving growth. This study uses national market scanner data to describe sales trends in traditional U.S. tobacco retail channels between 2012 and 2013 and identifies product features associated with sales increases. Methods: Data on e-cigarette sales in convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores, and mass merchandisers in the United States were obtained from the Nielsen Company. Each product was coded for attributes such as brand, flavor, and unit size. Total sales volume, market share, and percent growth were calculated for various product attributes. Results: E-cigarette sales more than doubled between 2012 and 2013, from $273.6 million to $636.2 million, respectively. Growth was particularly strong in the convenience store channel. Blu eCigs quickly emerged as the best-selling brand and in 2013 constituted nearly half (44.1%) of overall sales. Although fruit-flavored and other flavored products experienced marked growth, unflavored and menthol e-cigarettes overwhelmingly dominated the market. Sales of single unit products (likely disposable e-cigarettes) increased by 216.4%, a much faster rate than multi-unit packs and cartridge refills. Conclusions: In traditional U.S. retail channels, particularly the convenience store channel, sales of e-cigarettes continue to grow, with brands like blu and disposable products as the likely drivers. Given the rapidly-changing market, expanded surveillance is needed to monitor sales not only in traditional retail locations, but sales online and in specialty “vape shops,” as well.

2218,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Bayesian Inference: Understanding Experimental Data With Informative Hypotheses,article,"When analyzing experimental data, researchers will often test the null hypothesis that the means for all conditions are equal. In the event that the null hypothesis is rejected, researchers will conduct pairwise comparisons of the means to better understand the effect of an experimental manipulation. This exploratory procedure assumes that researchers do not know more about the data except that it corresponds to the experimental design. However, in designing an experiment, researchers commonly have clear expectations of how a manipulation will behave (e.g., in a three-arm design, both treatments will have similarly positive effects in comparison to the placebo control), often in light of prior studies and or relevant theory. Bayesian psychologists and statisticians refer to these expectations as informative hypotheses and have routinely emphasized testing them in a confirmatory fashion as a robust method of understanding experimental data. The current commentary overviews how to specify informative hypotheses for experimental means, test them via Bayes factors, and account for multiple testing within this analytical framework.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa120,,"Baig, Sabeeh A","Center for Tobacco Products, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD"

Materials and methods A total of 159 adult male volunteers aged 20 and above were included, with 54 current cigarette smokers, 52 current midwakh smokers and 53 non-smokers. Estimate of breath carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine were collected, as well as sociodemographic characteristics and details of smoking habits and second-hand smoke exposure among participants. Institutional review board approval was obtained and data were analysed using SPSS V.21 with the Kruskal-Wallis test used to obtain differences in the distribution. Results There was no significant difference in the median breath CO and salivary cotinine levels between cigarette and midwakh smokers. Levels of breath CO were significantly higher in cigarette and midwakh smokers as compared with non-smokers (19.5, 17.5 and 6.0, respectively, p<0.05); the same relationship was observed for cotinine levels among cigarette and midwakh smokers as compared with non-smokers (4.0, 3.0 and 0.0, respectively, p≤0.05). Additionally, the values of both salivary cotinine and breath CO increased with the frequency of tobacco use. Conclusion These are the first data that we are aware of that demonstrate that in terms of at least two key biomarkers of tobacco use, there are comparable levels of exposure between cigarettes and midwakh users, demonstrating a need for intensified attention to the use of midwakh.

779,Tobacco Control,2020,Evidence that an intervention weakens the relationship between adolescent electronic cigarette use and tobacco smoking: a 24-month prospective study,Research Article,"Background The electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use to subsequent smoking relationship in adolescents has received much attention. Whether an intervention to reduce smoking initiation attenuated this relationship was assessed. Method Data were from 3994 adolescent never smokers (aged 13–14 years at baseline) as part of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Self-report measures of smoking, e-cigarette use and covariates were assessed and used to predict ever smoked cigarettes, any recent tobacco smoking and regularly smoked cigarettes at 24-month follow-up. Results Baseline ever use of e-cigarettes was associated with ever smoked cigarettes (OR=4.03, 95% CI 3.33 to 4.88; controlling for covariates, OR=2.78, 95% CI 2.20 to 3.51), any recent tobacco smoking (OR=3.38, 95% CI 2.72 to 4.21; controlling for covariates, OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.76 to 2.69) and regularly smoked cigarettes (OR=3.60, 95% CI 2.35 to 5.51; controlling for covariates, OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.39) at follow-up. For ever smoked cigarettes only, the impact of e-cigarette use was attenuated in the intervention (OR=1.83) compared with control (OR=4.53) condition. For ever smoked cigarettes and any recent tobacco smoking, the impact of e-cigarette use was attenuated among those with friends who smoked (OR=2.05 (ever smoked); 1·53 (any tobacco use)) compared with those without friends who smoked (OR=3.32 (ever smoked); 2·17 (any tobacco use)). Conclusions This is one of the first studies to show that e-cigarette use was robustly associated with measures of smoking over 24 months and the first to show an intervention to attenuate the relationship. Further research with a broader age range of adolescents is required. ","Previous research: A growing number of studies (mainly among US and UK adolescents) indicate that self-reported e-cigarette use is associated with subsequent smoking initiation. However, in general, these studies were conducted over relatively short time periods (12 months), focused only on smoking initiation and not on more regular smoking, did not validate their self-reported smoking measures against objective measures and did not examine the impact of smoking prevention interventions. Interpretation: The present research replicates previous findings in this area in showing a significant association between e-cigarette use and subsequent smoking initiation. It also shows similar effects for measures of regular smoking. These relationships were observed over a period of 24 months in measures of ever smoked cigarettes, any recent tobacco smoking and regularly smoked cigarettes. The strength of these associations was reduced but remained significant when controlling for various predictors of smoking. Importantly, the present research showed for the first time that an intervention to reduce smoking initiation attenuated the relationship between e-cigarette use and ever smoked cigarettes (although it remained significant). This suggests the value of interventions to reduce smoking initiation even in groups of adolescents who try e-cigarettes first. Similar to recent UK studies, the present data also showed that the relationship between e-cigarette use and ever smoked cigarettes or any recent tobacco smoking was stronger in those with no friends who smoked at baseline (a group usually thought to be at low risk of starting smoking) versus some friends who smoked at the initial time point. These latter findings are more consistent with the view that e-cigarette use is a risk factor for smoking initiation than the view that e-cigarette use may simply be a marker for those who would go on to smoke cigarettes even without having tried e-cigarettes. However, it is notable that this moderation effect was not observed for regular smoking.

64,Tobacco Control,2015,Effectiveness of a national reimbursement policy and accompanying media attention on use of cessation treatment and on smoking cessation: a real-world study in the Netherlands,Research Article,"Background In 2011, the Netherlands implemented a national policy that ensured that health insurance companies reimbursed behavioural counselling for smoking cessation or the combination of behavioural counselling with pharmacological therapy. Objective To examine the real-world impact of a national reimbursement policy and accompanying media attention on use of cessation treatment and on smoking cessation. Methods We used a four-wave longitudinal survey among 2763 adult smokers that started in September 2010 and was repeated at approximately 3 month intervals until June 2011. Two survey waves were conducted before the implementation of the policy and two survey waves after. Findings There were significant increases in quit attempts (among moderate-to-heavy smokers) and in quit success (among all smokers) following the implementation of the reimbursement policy and the media attention. Use of behavioural counselling did not increase, while use of pharmacological therapy without behavioural counselling (unreimbursed treatment) increased among moderate-to-heavy smokers. Attention to media about the reimbursement was significantly associated with more quit attempts and more quit success. Awareness of the policy was significantly associated with more use of reimbursed treatment among all smokers, while attention to the media coverage was only significantly associated with more use of reimbursed treatment among moderate-to-heavy smokers. Awareness/attention variables were not significantly associated with use of unreimbursed treatment. Conclusions It seems that a national reimbursement policy for smoking cessation treatment that is accompanied by media attention can increase cessation. Our findings suggest that this increase can (partly) be ascribed to the media attention that accompanied the policy implementation. ",A national reimbursement policy in the Netherlands in 2011 that was accompanied by media attention was followed by an increase in quit attempts among moderate-to-heavy smokers and an increase in quit success among all smokers.

2306,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Beliefs and Self-reported Practices of Health Care Professionals Regarding Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review and Synthesis,article,"Aims This review explores the (1) beliefs and attitudes of health care professionals (HCPs) toward electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including use as a smoking cessation aid and/or harm reduction, safety and regulation, and (2) the extent and content of patient–HCP communication about ENDS. Methods PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched to identify articles published since 2003. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklists were used to assess the quality of studies. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze qualitative data. Results A total of 45 articles (32 quantitative, 12 qualitative, and 1 mixed) were included. There was wide variation regarding beliefs about the efficacy of ENDS as a cessation aid. Although the majority of HCPs believes that ENDS are safer than combustible cigarettes, they also have concern about the short and long-term safety of ENDS, uptake by adolescents, and the potential for ENDS to act as a “gateway” to smoking cigarettes. Beliefs about ENDS are influenced by media stories and experiences provided by patients. Although most HCPs do not proactively recommend ENDS, they are more likely to support ENDS use among patients with smoking related comorbidities, heavy smokers with previous unsuccessful quit attempts, or patients who express interest in trying them. Conclusions Overall, HCPs hold diverse views about the efficacy of ENDS and expressed wariness over their potential health effects. HCP endorsement of ENDS use seems to depend largely on patient health status, the presence of other competing risk factors and patient preferences. Implication Although evidence on safety and efficacy of ENDS is emerging, HCPs should be honest with their clients, stating that the long-term safety is not yet established but what is known is that they appear to be a lower risk alternative to cigarettes. Our review highlights a need for further training and support for HCPs regarding ENDS use, which would enable them to guide their clients in making evidence-based decisions.

1922,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Quitting Failure and Success With and Without Using Medication: Latent Classes of Abstinence and Adherence to Nicotine Monotherapy, Combination Therapy, and Varenicline",article,"Introduction Nonadherence to pharmacotherapies complicates studies of comparative pharmacotherapy effectiveness. Modeling adherence and abstinence simultaneously may facilitate analysis of both treatment acceptability and effectiveness. Methods Secondary analyses of a three-arm randomized comparative trial of nicotine patch, varenicline, and combination nicotine patch and lozenge among adult daily smokers (N = 1086) were conducted. Adherence rates collected via interactive voice response systems during the first 27 days of quitting were compared across treatment conditions. Repeated measures latent class analyses of adherence and abstinence in 3-day parcels through 27 days of a quit attempt were conducted with treatment, demographic, and smoking history covariates. Results Adherence varied across treatments and was lowest for nicotine lozenge use in combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Five latent classes that differed significantly in 6-month abstinence rates were retained, including three subgroups of adherent participants varying in treatment response and two nonadherent groups varying in abstinence probabilities. Nonadherence was more likely among those receiving varenicline and combination NRT, relative to patch monotherapy. Varenicline and combination NRT did not promote abstinence among adherent latent classes but did promote abstinence among those partially adherent, relative to patch alone. Combination therapy attenuated increased risk of treatment disengagement with more years smoking. Minority smokers, those high in dependence, and those with shorter past abstinence were at increased risk for low-adherence and low-abstinence latent classes. Conclusions Varenicline and combination nicotine patch and lozenge are less likely to be used as directed and may not increase first-month abstinence better than patch alone when taken adherently. Implications This secondary analysis of adherence and abstinence in a comparative effectiveness trial shows that adherence is highest for the nicotine patch, next highest for varenicline, and lowest for combination nicotine patch and lozenge therapy due to low lozenge use. Distinct latent classes were found that varied in both first-month abstinence and adherence. Varenicline and combination NRT may not enhance abstinence over patch alone among smokers who take medication adherently. Adherent use of medication especially benefits those who are low in dependence and have positive quitting histories; it is less beneficial to at-risk smokers and members of racial minorities.

2395,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Characterization of Nicotine Salts in 23 Electronic Cigarette Refill Liquids,article,"Introduction Many electronic cigarette manufacturers have begun offering liquids containing “nicotine salts,” which are formed when an acid is mixed in a solution with free-base nicotine. Type of salt could play a significant role in the abuse liability of electronic cigarette liquids. As a first step to understanding nicotine salts, this study sought to identify the types of acids present in 23 commercially available electronic cigarette liquids. Aims and Methods Twenty-three electronic cigarette liquids advertised as containing nicotine salts were purchased for analysis. These liquids were tested for the presence of 11 different organic acids that were deemed likely to be used in a nicotine salt formulation. Liquids were analyzed using a combination of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry methods, then compared to authentic acid standards for identification. Results Six of the 11 possible acids were identified in the liquids, from most to least common: lactic, benzoic, levulinic, salicyclic, malic, and tartaric acid. Acid(s) could not be identified in one of the liquids. Though most liquids contained only one type, three of the liquids contained multiple acids. Conclusions These data demonstrate that several types of salts/acids are currently being used in electronic cigarette liquids. The type and concentration of salt(s) used in these liquids may differentially alter sensations in the throat and upper airway, and overall pharmacology of the aerosols by altering liquid pH and from flavor and sensory characteristics of the acids themselves. Implications This study demonstrates that at least six different types of acids are being used to create the nicotine salts in electronic cigarette liquids, with the acids lactic, benzoic, and levulinic being the most frequently identified. Identification of these acids can serve as the foundation for future research to determine if type of nicotine salt alters pharmacological and toxicological effects of electronic cigarettes.

320,Tobacco Control,2016,Flavourings significantly affect inhalation toxicity of aerosol generated from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS),Research Article,"Background E-cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are designed to deliver nicotine-containing aerosol via inhalation. Little is known about the health effects of flavoured ENDS aerosol when inhaled. Methods Aerosol from ENDS was generated using a smoking machine. Various types of ENDS devices or a tank system prefilled with liquids of different flavours, nicotine carrier, variable nicotine concentrations and with modified battery output voltage were tested. A convenience sample of commercial fluids with flavour names of tobacco, piña colada, menthol, coffee and strawberry were used. Flavouring chemicals were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. H292 human bronchial epithelial cells were directly exposed to 55 puffs of freshly generated ENDS aerosol, tobacco smoke or air (controls) using an air–liquid interface system and the Health Canada intense smoking protocol. The following in vitro toxicological effects were assessed: (1) cell viability, (2) metabolic activity and (3) release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines). Results Exposure to ENDS aerosol resulted in decreased metabolic activity and cell viability and increased release of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL10 compared to air controls. Cell viability and metabolic activity were more adversely affected by conventional cigarettes than most tested ENDS products. Product type, battery output voltage and flavours significantly affected toxicity of ENDS aerosol, with a strawberry-flavoured product being the most cytotoxic. Conclusions Our data suggest that characteristics of ENDS products, including flavours, may induce inhalation toxicity. Therefore, ENDS users should use the products with caution until more comprehensive studies are performed. ","The extent to which various product features and ingredients, including flavourings, impact electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) safety and potential toxicity is currently not well defined. We tested different types and brands of flavoured ENDS on cell viability, cell metabolic activity and release of inflammatory cytokines in bronchial epithelial cells exposed in vitro directly to freshly generated ENDS aerosol. We found that various ENDS products differ with regard to their cellular toxicity and can cause different inflammatory reactions in cells directly exposed to aerosols. This study revealed that flavours significantly affect the in vitro toxicity profile of the ENDS products, and among all tested flavours, a commercially available fluid labelled strawberry was the most toxic.

1001,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Trends in Use of Little Cigars or Cigarillos and Cigarettes among U.S. Smokers, 2002–2011",article,"Objectives: Little cigars and cigarillos may resemble cigarettes, but may be less expensive and can be purchased singly and in flavored varieties. We used two major U.S. surveys to investigate use of cigarillos and cigarettes. Methods: The 2010/2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey ascertained cigar use by brand and type (little cigars/cigarillos or large/regular). The annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) assessed cigar use by brand, 2002–2011. We used the available data to classify cigars by type among males in the NSDUH. Results: Estimated prevalence of little cigar use among male cigar smokers was similar using the two surveys. From 2002 to 2011, past-30-day cigarette smoking declined for all age groups and genders, but among young adult men (aged 18–25) little cigar smoking remained steady at nearly 9%. “Cigarette and/or cigar” smoking was 44% among young adult men in 2011, and was consistently 6 percentage points higher than cigarette-only smoking, from 2002 to 2011. Over 60% of male and 70% of female adolescent/young adult cigar smokers also smoked cigarettes in 2011. Most male adolescents preferred little cigars to traditional cigars. Among males, most lower income or less educated cigar smokers preferred little cigars, compared to only 16% of those with higher education. Conclusions: These patterns indicate that little cigar/cigarillo use may promote initiation and maintenance of cigarette smoking, particularly among younger and less advantaged populations. Population-level data are urgently needed to better assess type of cigar smoked and reasons for use.

2428,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Predictors of Smoking Cessation Attempts and Success Following Motivation-Phase Interventions Among People Initially Unwilling to Quit Smoking,article,"Introduction Most people who smoke cigarettes are not willing (ie, not ready) to make a quit attempt (QA) at any given time. Unfortunately, interventions intended to increase QAs and the success of QAs are only modestly effective. Identifying processes leading to QAs and quitting success could guide intervention development. Aims and Methods This is a secondary analysis of a randomized factorial trial of 6 weeks of motivation-phase interventions among primary care patients (N = 517) who were initially unwilling to quit but were willing to reduce their smoking. Using logistic regression, we controlled for treatment condition and tested whether baseline or change in smoking-related constructs after 6 weeks of treatment predicted (1) making an at least 24 h QA between weeks 6 and 26 and (2) quitting success at week 26 (7-day point-prevalence abstinence among those who made a QA). Predictors included cigarettes/day, time to first cigarette, motivation to quit, quitting self-efficacy, anticipated urges to smoke if quit, positive affect, negative affect, and time spent around others who smoke. Results In multivariable models that included all smoking-related constructs, changes in the following variables predicted initiating a QA above and beyond other variables: greater baseline time to first cigarette (odds ratio [OR] = 1.60), increases in time to first cigarette (OR = 1.27), and increases in quitting self-efficacy (OR = 1.14). Increased motivation to quit predicted conversion of a QA into quitting success at 26 weeks (OR = 1.36). Conclusion Predictors of making a QA differed from predictors of quitting success. Predictors of QAs and success could each serve as important treatment targets of motivation-phase interventions. Implications Motivation-phase interventions for people initially unwilling to quit smoking cigarettes may be improved by striving to increase their (1) time to first cigarette and quitting self-efficacy to promote QAs and (2) motivation to quit to promote quit success. Future experimental tests of such interventions are needed to identify causal determinants of QAs and quitting success.

479,Tobacco Control,2018,Effect of message congruency on attention and recall in pictorial health warning labels,Other,"Objective The nine pictorial health warning labels (PWLs) proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration vary in format and feature of visual and textual information. Congruency is the degree to which visual and textual features reflect a common theme. This characteristic can affect attention and recall of label content. This study investigates the effect of congruency in PWLs on smoker’s attention and recall of label content. Methods 120 daily smokers were randomly assigned to view either congruent or incongruent PWLs, while having their eye movements recorded. Participants were asked to recall label content immediately after exposure and 5 days later. Results Overall, the image was viewed more and recalled better than the text. Smokers in the incongruent condition spent more time focusing on the text than smokers in the congruent condition (p=0.03), but dwell time of the image did not differ. Despite lower dwell time on the text, smokers in the congruent condition were more likely to correctly recall it on day 1 (p=0.02) and the risk message of the PWLs on both day 1 (p=0.01) and day 5 (p=0.006) than smokers in the incongruent condition. Conclusions This study identifies an important design feature of PWLs and demonstrates objective differences in how smokers process PWLs. Our results suggest that message congruency between visual and textual information is beneficial to recall of label content. Moreover, images captured and held smokers’ attention better than the text. ","Images in pictorial health warning labels capture and hold attention, as objectively measured with eye tracking.

950,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,"Effects of User Puff Topography, Device Voltage, and Liquid Nicotine Concentration on Electronic Cigarette Nicotine Yield: Measurements and Model Predictions",article,"Introduction: Some electronic cigarette (ECIG) users attain tobacco cigarette–like plasma nicotine concentrations while others do not. Understanding the factors that influence ECIG aerosol nicotine delivery is relevant to regulation, including product labeling and abuse liability. These factors may include user puff topography, ECIG liquid composition, and ECIG design features. This study addresses how these factors can influence ECIG nicotine yield. Methods: Aerosols were machine generated with 1 type of ECIG cartridge (V4L CoolCart) using 5 distinct puff profiles representing a tobacco cigarette smoker (2-s puff duration, 33-ml/s puff velocity), a slow average ECIG user (4 s, 17 ml/s), a fast average user (4 s, 33 ml/s), a slow extreme user (8 s, 17 ml/s), and a fast extreme user (8 s, 33 ml/s). Output voltage (3.3–5.2 V or 3.0–7.5 W) and e-liquid nicotine concentration (18–36 mg/ml labeled concentration) were varied. A theoretical model was also developed to simulate the ECIG aerosol production process and to provide insight into the empirical observations. Results: Nicotine yields from 15 puffs varied by more than 50-fold across conditions. Experienced ECIG user profiles (longer puffs) resulted in higher nicotine yields relative to the tobacco smoker (shorter puffs). Puff velocity had no effect on nicotine yield. Higher nicotine concentration and higher voltages resulted in higher nicotine yields. These results were predicted well by the theoretical model (R2 = 0.99). Conclusions: Depending on puff conditions and product features, 15 puffs from an ECIG can provide far less or far more nicotine than a single tobacco cigarette. ECIG emissions can be predicted using physical principles, with knowledge of puff topography and a few ECIG device design parameters.

1762,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Substantial Toxic Effect of Water-Pipe Smoking on the Early Stage of Embryonic Development,article,"Background Water-pipe smoking (WPS) is the most widespread tobacco use in the Middle-East, and is rapidly spreading globally. Smoke from WP contains most of the compounds present in cigarette smoke, although in different proportions. WPS is associated with the risk of several human diseases; however, its impact on the early stage of normal development has not been investigated yet. Thus, in this investigation, we assess the effect of WPS on the embryo at the early stage of development. Methods Chicken embryos at 3 days of incubations were used in this study. Meanwhile, we explored the outcome of WPS on angiogenesis using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryos. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to study the regulation of some key control genes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. Results Our data reveal that WPS inhibits angiogenesis of the CAM and in embryos in comparison with their matched controls; in addition, WPS-exposed embryos show slight reduction in their sizes. We also noted that around 80% of WPS-exposed embryos die before 10 days of incubation. More significantly, WPS induces upregulations of BCL-2, Caspase-8, ATF-3, INHIB-A, and Cadherin 6 genes, which are important key regulators of cell apoptosis, proliferation, and migration. Conclusion Our data reveal, for the first time, that WPS has very toxic effects during the early stage of embryogenesis. Thus, we believe that further studies are required to elucidate the pathogenic effect of WPS on human health especially on the embryo at the early stage of its development. Implications This investigation addresses an important gap on the outcome of WPS during the early stage of embryogenesis. Data of this study point out that WPS can have a very toxic effect on the embryo at this stage. Additionally, results from this report display for the first time that WPS can damage normal angiogenesis of the embryo thus provoking a significant number of embryonic death. Moreover, this study reveals that this effect can occur via the deregulation of several genes related to cell apoptosis, proliferation, and migration.

2320,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Withdrawal Symptoms From E-Cigarette Abstinence Among Former Smokers: A Pre–Post Clinical Trial,article,"Introduction The major aim of this study was to test whether abstinence from e-cigarettes causes withdrawal symptoms in former smokers. Methods We conducted an unblinded, within-participants, pre–post clinical trial in which 109 former smokers who were current daily electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users used their own e-cigarette for 7 days followed by 6 days of biologically confirmed abstinence engendered via an escalating contingency payment system. Participants monitored symptoms of nicotine withdrawal daily via an Interactive Voice Response system. They also attended three laboratory visits per week for carbon monoxide and cotinine testing to verify abstinence. Results Half of participants completely abstained for a week. All the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) tobacco withdrawal symptoms, craving for e-cigarettes, craving for tobacco cigarettes, and the four possible new withdrawal symptoms (anhedonia, impulsivity, mood swings, and positive affect) increased during abstinence. Weight increased and heart rate decreased with abstinence. Symptoms showed the prototypical inverted U time pattern of a withdrawal state. The magnitude of withdrawal appeared to be somewhat less than that in a prior study of abstinent daily tobacco cigarette smokers. More severe withdrawal on the first 2 days of abstinence did not predict abstinence on the last day of the study. Conclusions Former smokers who are daily e-cigarette users transfer physical dependence on tobacco cigarettes to dependence on e-cigarettes. The severity of withdrawal from e-cigarettes appears to be only somewhat less than that from daily tobacco cigarette use. Replication tests that include placebo controls, testing for pharmacological specificity, and including never-smokers, non-daily e-cigarette users and dual users are indicated. Implications Our results indicate e-cigarettes can maintain physical dependence. This adverse effect should be included in any risk vs. benefit calculation. Also, potential and current e-cigarette users should be informed that abrupt cessation of e-cigarettes can cause withdrawal symptoms. Trial registration NCT02825459.

1994,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Enhanced Sensory–Cognitive Processing by Activation of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors,article," Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhances sensory–cognitive function in human subjects and animal models, yet the neural mechanisms are not fully understood. This review summarizes recent studies on nicotinic regulation of neural processing in the cerebral cortex that point to potential mechanisms underlying enhanced cognitive function. Studies from our laboratory focus on nicotinic regulation of auditory cortex and implications for auditory–cognitive processing, but relevant emerging insights from multiple brain regions are discussed. Although the major contributions of the predominant nAChRs containing α7 (homomeric receptors) or α4 and β2 (heteromeric) subunits are well recognized, recent results point to additional, potentially critical contributions from α2 subunits that are relatively sparse in cortex. Ongoing studies aim to elucidate the specific contributions to cognitive and cortical function of diverse nAChRs. Implications This review highlights the therapeutic potential of activating nAChRs in the cerebral cortex to enhance cognitive function. Future work also must determine the contributions of relatively rare but important nAChR subtypes, potentially to develop more selective treatments for cognitive deficits.

We previously reported that AT-1001, a selective α3β4* nAChR ligand binds with high affinity to rat α3β4 and human α3β4α5 nAChR, antagonizes epibatidine-induced activation of rat α3β4 nAChR in HEK cells and potently inhibits nicotine self-administration in rats. Methods: Two-electrode voltage clamp was used for functional characterization of AT-1001 at recombinant human α3β4 and α4β2 nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Results: Concentration-response curves show that AT-1001 is a partial agonist at human α3β4 nAChR, evoking up to 35% of the maximal acetylcholine (ACh) response (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.37 μM). AT-1001 showed very little agonist activity at the α4β2 nAChR, evoking only 6% of the ACh response (EC50 = 1.5 μM). Pre- and co-application of various concentrations of AT-1001 with 50 μM ACh revealed a complex pattern of activation-inhibition by AT-1001 at α3β4 nAChR, which was best fitted by a 2-site equation. At α4β2 nAChR, co-exposure of AT-1001 with ACh only showed inhibition of ACh current with a shallower curve. Conclusions: AT-1001 is a partial agonist at the human α3β4 nAChR and causes desensitization at concentrations at which it evokes an inward current, resulting in an overall functional antagonism of α3β4 nAChR. AT-1001 does not significantly activate or desensitize α4β2 nAChR at the same concentrations as at the α3β4 nAChR, but does inhibit ACh responses at α4β2 nAChR at higher concentrations. A combination of these mechanisms may underlie the inhibition of nicotine self-administration by AT-1001, suggesting that AT-1001 and compounds from this class may have clinical potential for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy.

475,Tobacco Control,2018,Factual text and emotional pictures: overcoming a false dichotomy of cigarette warning labels,Other,"Background In reviewing the first set of pictorial warning labels in the USA, the courts equated textual labels with facts and information, and images with emotion. This study tested the differences in perceived informativeness and emotion between textual and pictorial cigarette warning labels. Methods An online study with 1838 US adults who were non-smokers (n=764), transitioning smokers (quit smoking in the past 2 years or currently trying to quit, n=505) or current smokers (n=569). Each participant evaluated 9 out of 81 text and pictorial cigarette warning labels. Participants reported to what extent they perceived the label as informative and factual and the negative emotions they felt while looking at each label. We used linear mixed models to account for the nesting of multiple observations within each participant. Results There were no significant differences in perceived informativeness between textual (mean 6.15 on a 9-point scale) and pictorial labels (6.14, p=0.80, Cohen’s d=0.003). Textual labels evoked slightly less emotion (4.21 on a 9-point scale) than pictorial labels (4.42, p<0.001, Cohen’s d=0.08). Perceived informativeness and emotion were strongly correlated (Pearson r=0.53, p<0.001). Conclusion Our findings contradict courts’ conclusions that pictorial messages are emotional and not factual. Pictorial labels are rated as informative and factual, textual labels evoke emotion, and emotionality and informativeness are strongly correlated. These findings serve as evidence for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to counteract the claim that pictorial warning labels, by definition, are not ‘purely factual and uncontroversial’.

1701,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Financial Incentives for Smoking Abstinence in Homeless Smokers: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,article,"Introduction Three-quarters of homeless people smoke cigarettes. Financial incentives for smoking abstinence have appeared promising in nonexperimental studies of homeless smokers, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) data are lacking. Methods We conducted a pilot RCT of financial incentives for homeless smokers. Incentive arm participants (N = 25) could earn escalating $15–$35 rewards for brief smoking abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide <8 parts per million) assessed 14 times over 8 weeks. Control arm participants (N = 25) were given $10 at each assessment regardless of abstinence. All participants were offered nicotine patches and counseling. The primary outcome was a repeated measure of brief smoking abstinence across 14 assessments. The secondary outcome was brief abstinence at 8 weeks. Exploratory outcomes were self-reported 1-day and 7-day abstinence from (1) any cigarette and (2) any puff of a cigarette. Other outcomes included 24-hour quit attempts, nicotine patch use, counseling attendance, and changes in alcohol and drug use. Results Compared to control, incentive arm participants were more likely to achieve brief abstinence overall (odds ratio 7.28, 95% confidence interval 2.89 to 18.3) and at 8 weeks (48% vs. 8%, p = .004). Similar effects were seen for 1-day abstinence, but 7-day puff abstinence was negligible in both arms. Incentive arm participants made more quit attempts (p = .03). Nicotine patch use and counseling attendance were not significantly different between the groups. Alcohol and drug use did not change significantly in either group. Conclusions Among homeless smokers, financial incentives increased brief smoking abstinence and quit attempts without worsening substance use. This approach merits further development focused on promoting sustained abstinence. Registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02565381) Implications Smoking is common among homeless people, and conventional tobacco treatment strategies have yielded modest results in this population. This pilot RCT suggests that financial incentives may be a safe way to promote brief smoking abstinence and quit attempts in this vulnerable group of smokers. However, further development is necessary to translate this approach into real-world settings and to promote sustained periods of smoking abstinence.

537,Tobacco Control,2018,Price elasticity of demand of non-cigarette tobacco products: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Other,"Objective To systematically review the price elasticity of demand of non-cigarette tobacco products. Data sources Medline, Embase, EconLit and the Web of Science without language or time restrictions. Study selection Two reviewers screened title and abstracts, then full texts, independently and in duplicate. We based eligibility criteria on study design (interventional or observational), population (individuals or communities without geographic restrictions), intervention (price change) and outcome (change in demand). Data extraction We abstracted data on study features, outcome measures, statistical approach, and single best own- and cross-price elasticity estimates with respect to cigarettes. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis for estimates of similar product, outcome and country income level. For other studies we reported median elasticities by product and country income level. Data synthesis We analysed 36 studies from 15 countries yielding 125 elasticity estimates. A 10% price increase would reduce demand by: 8.3% for cigars (95% CI 2.9 to 13.8), 6.4% for roll your owns (95% CI 4.3 to 8.4), 5.7% for bidis (95% CI 4.3 to 7.1) and 2.1% for smokeless tobacco (95% CI −0.6 to 4.8). Median price elasticities for all ten products were also negative. Results from few studies that examined cross-price elasticity suggested a positive substitution effect between cigarette and non-cigarette tobacco products. Conclusions There is sufficient evidence in support of the effectiveness of price increases to reduce consumption of non-cigarette tobacco products as it is for cigarettes. Positive substitutability between cigarette and non-cigarette tobacco products suggest that tax and price increases need to be simultaneous and comparable across all tobacco products.

1394,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Case to Include Brand of Moist Snuff in Health Surveys,article,"Introduction: Brand of smokeless tobacco was added to the most recent Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS), but deleted from the Centers for Disease Control’s National Adult Tobacco Survey. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of brand in distinguishing users of moist snuff. Methods:  The sample consisted of participants from the 2010–2011 TUS-CPS who reported having used one of 14 brands of moist snuff in the past month ( n = 2334). The brands were categorized into one of three types: snus, discount snuff, premium snuff. Multinomial logistic regression was employed for testing for associations between brand type and a series of demographic and tobacco use measures.  Results:  Females, metropolitan residents, current smokers, and moderate users of snuff had significantly greater odds of using snus relative to premium snuff in the adjusted model ( P < .001). Frequent users of snuff (eg, daily users), current smokers, young adults, participants with low household income, and those exhibiting dependence on nicotine had greater odds of using discount versus premium snuff. Separate analyses among current smokers ( n = 470) and former smokers ( n = 70) revealed positive associations between smoking cessation attempts and smokers’ switch to discount snuff.  Conclusions: Differences among the three categories of snuff users are likely attributed to variations in marketing campaigns. The differences are sufficient to warrant inclusion of snuff brand in health surveys because brand type could serve as a proxy measure for snuff use and dependence. Implications: Inclusion of brand of moist snuff in health surveys will enable researchers to categorize snuff users by brand type. Findings from this study indicate that brand type, defined according to cost (ie, discount vs. premium brands) and type of preferred snuff (ie, snus vs. other moist snuff), can distinguish snuff users by various demographic and tobacco use measures. Consequently, categorization by brand type could be used as a proxy measure for studies whose surveys do not include detailed information on snuff use and behavior.

2497,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Co-use and Mixing Tobacco With Cannabis Among Ontario Adults,article,"Introduction The legalization of nonmedical cannabis in 2018 may have important implications for tobacco use in Canada. There is a risk of renormalizing tobacco use with co-use of tobacco and cannabis introducing nontobacco users to tobacco. Co-use is the use of both substances by the same individual at the same time or on different occasions, as well as mixed together. This study assessed the prevalence of co-use and mixing of tobacco and cannabis among Ontario adults and the characteristics of the users. Aims and Methods Data from the 1996 to 2017 cycles of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Monitor (n = 4481) were used to examine trends in prevalence and the proportion of Ontario adults co-using and mixing tobacco and cannabis. Logistic regression was used to study associations between user characteristics and co-use and mixing. Results Co-use of cigarettes and cannabis among cannabis users declined from 59.8% in 1996 to 41.7% in 2017. Past-year e-cigarette use was the only predictor of co-use. From 2015 to 2017, 31.1% (95% confidence interval 27.0, 35.9) of Ontario adults who used cannabis reported mixing it with tobacco in the past year. Being white, past-year e-cigarette use, having moderate or high nicotine dependence, and having moderate or high risk for cannabis problems were significant predictors of mixing among cannabis users. Conclusion Given the well-established negative health effects associated with tobacco use, alongside a growing evidence base for negative health effects of cannabis smoking, co-use and mixing could pose a considerable public health concern in the context of legalization. Implications Considerable effort has been expended to reduce tobacco smoking. However, current efforts to reduce tobacco smoking may be diminished since this study found the prevalence of mixing tobacco and cannabis among cannabis users in Ontario to be higher than expected. Mixing tobacco and cannabis may introduce nontobacco smokers to tobacco, exposing them to health risks associated with both cannabis and tobacco smoke. Therefore, there is a need to monitor changes in tobacco use and understanding implications for tobacco control and cessation programs within the changing environment of cannabis legalization in Canada and other jurisdictions.

1132,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Implementation of the Tobacco-Free Campus Policy on College Campuses: Evidence From a Survey of College Students in Beijing,article,"Objective: China issued a nationwide “Tobacco-Free Campus” Policy (TFCP) in January 2014, but it is unclear how well it was implemented across China’s 2138 college campuses. We conducted an Internet survey of Beijing college students to evaluate the implementation of the TFCP in Beijing. Methods: An Internet survey of 711 students from 37 colleges in Beijing was conducted in May 2015. Respondents reported on secondhand smoking (SHS) exposure on campus, knowledge on and actions taken against SHS, and tobacco marketing exposure on campus. Results: Almost 90% of respondents were exposed to SHS on campus at least once in the past month. Approximately 37% of nonsmokers and 61% of smokers reported seeing a teacher smoking, and the majority of both smokers and nonsmokers reported seeing a classmate smoking in campus buildings. The likelihood and location of SHS exposure depend on the participant’s demographics and own smoking behavior. Nonsmokers were more likely to be aware of the health risk of SHS than smokers. Although most participants were aware of the harms, only 13% and 9% tried to stop their last SHS exposure indoors and outdoors, respectively. Forty-seven students from 14 colleges noticed tobacco marketing activities on campus. Conclusions: The TFCP on Chinese college campuses was only partially enforced, particularly with regard to SHS. Implications: On January 29, 2014, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued the TFCP. A major barrier to effective tobacco control in China is the difficulty in implementing policies issued by the central government. At this point, it is unclear whether the TFCP was successfully implemented on China’s college campuses. Major tobacco use monitoring efforts do not include college students. The present research describes the current tobacco control environment on Beijing’s college campuses 15 months after the TFCP took effect. To our knowledge, this is the first paper in the English literature on tobacco environment and exposure (rather than a prevalence survey) of college students in China.

1665,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Adherence to Pharmacological Smoking Cessation Interventions: A Literature Review and Synthesis of Correlates and Barriers,article,"Introduction Efficacious pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation are available, but poor adherence to these treatments may limit these interventions overall impact. To improve adherence to smoking cessation interventions, it is first necessary to identify and understand smoker-level characteristics that drive nonadherence (ie, nonconformance with a provider’s recommendation of timing, dosage, or frequency of medication-taking during the prescribed length of time). Methods We present a literature review of studies examining correlates of, or self-reported reasons for, nonadherence to smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Studies were identified through PubMed—using MeSH terms, Embase—using Emtree terms, and ISI Web of Science. Results and Conclusions This literature review included 50 studies that examined nonpreventable (eg, sociodemographics) and preventable (eg, forgetfulness) factors associated with adherence to smoking cessation medication and suggestions for overcoming some of the identified barriers. Systematic study of this topic would be facilitated by consistent reporting of adherence and correlates thereof in the literature, development of consistent definitions of medication adherence across studies, utilization of more objective measures of adherence (eg, blood plasma levels vs. self-report) in addition to reliance on self-reported adherence. Implications This article provides the most comprehensive review to date on correlates of adherence to pharmacological smoking cessation interventions. Challenges and specific gaps in the literature that should be a priority for future research are discussed. Future priorities include additional research, particularly among vulnerable populations of smokers, developing standardized definitions of adherence and methods for measuring adherence, regular assessment of cessation pharmacotherapy adherence in the context of research and clinical practice, and development of novel treatments aimed at preventable barriers to medication adherence.

828,Tobacco Control,2020,Tracking and tracing the tobacco industry: potential tobacco industry influence over the EU’s system for tobacco traceability and security features,Research Article,"Background Subsequent to the transnational tobacco companies’ (TTC) history of involvement in tobacco smuggling, the Illicit Trade Protocol (ITP) requires that tobacco tracking and tracing (T&T) systems be established independent of the industry. In response, TTCs developed a T&T system, originally called Codentify, promoting it via an elaborate set of front groups to create a false impression of independence. The European Union (EU) is one of the first and largest jurisdictions to operationalise T&T. We explore how industry efforts to influence T&T have evolved. Methods Analysis of tobacco industry documents, policy documents, submissions to a relevant consultation and relationships between the tobacco industry and organisations proposed by it and approved by the European Commission to provide a data repository function within the EU’s T&T system. Findings 17 months after TTCs sold Codentify to Inexto and Philip Morris International claimed Inexto was independent, leaked documents suggest TTCs and Inexto continued to have a financial and operational relationship. Inexto’s meetings with TTCs, engagement with EU Member States and promotion of industry-favoured technical standards suggest TTCs influenced Inexto’s activities, using the company to undermine EU T&T. The EU’s T&T system appears to be inconsistent with the ITP due to its ‘mixed’ governance and seven of eight organisations approved as data repository providers having pre-existing industry business links. Conclusions TTC’s efforts to maximise their control and minimise external scrutiny of T&T systems seriously limit attempts to address tobacco smuggling. Countries implementing T&T should be alert to such efforts and should not replicate the EU system. ","The European Commission uses three criteria to establish the independence of a third-party, including unique identifier (non-removable identification markings which are affixed to or form part of unit packs) issuers and data repository providers, involved in the T&T system from the tobacco industry: Legal, organisational and decision-making independence. Financial independence (that less than 10% of a third-party’s annual worldwide turnover comes ‘from goods and services supplied to the tobacco sector over the past two calendar years’.31 The threshold then becomes 20% for each subsequent year.30 No explanation is provided as to why these particular thresholds were chosen. Absence of conflicts of interests, namely that directors and other governing individuals have not participated in tobacco industry company structures in the last 5 years and shall act independently from any financial or other links to the tobacco industry such as tobacco stocks or private pension programmes.30 The Illicit Trade Protocol (ITP) requires countries to implement a track and trace system for tobacco independent of the tobacco industry. Yet the tobacco industry has a vested interest in controlling any tobacco tracking and tracing system in order to avoid scrutiny and minimise its excise payments. The industry’s attempts to have its Codentify-based system implemented as a tracking and tracing solution have become increasingly opaque, including using third-parties to create the false impression that the system is independent from industry. In December 2017, the European Commission adopted regulations for tracking and tracing in the EU based on the text of the 2014 TPD. On 20 May 2019, tracking and tracing for cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco was implemented in the EU, based on these regulations. 17 months after the sale of Codentify to Inexto and PMI’s claim that Inexto was independent from the industry, internal documents suggest the industry and Inexto continued to have a financial and operational relationship. They jointly promoted industry tracking and tracing objectives by engaging with EU Member States and proposing technical standards which would have handed tobacco companies further control of the EU’s tracking and tracing system. This study is the first evaluation of tobacco tracking and tracing operationalisation. It finds that the tobacco industry has succeeded in undermining the independence of the EU’s track and trace system. The system delegates key responsibilities to the industry and associated third-parties, raising serious concerns about its compliance with the ITP. The European Commission and Member States should take further steps to protect EU tracking and tracing from industry manipulation and other ITP parties must ensure that their own tracking and tracing systems are fully consistent with the ITP and its values and do not replicate the EU’s model.

713,Tobacco Control,2019,"Tobacco taxation, illegal cigarette supply and geography: findings from the ITC Uruguay Surveys",Research Article,"Background In Uruguay, real tobacco taxes increased significantly during 2005–2010 and 2014–2017 and decreased during 2010–2014. The effects of these tax changes on illegal and legal cigarette usage differed significantly when we compared cities in the middle and south of the country with cities on the border. Objective This paper analyses whether supply side factors such as geographical location, distribution networks and the effectiveness of tobacco control play a significant role in sales and use of illegal cigarettes when tobacco taxes change, particularly given the price gap between legal and lower-priced illegal cigarettes. Methods Using the International Tobacco Control Evaluation Project Uruguay Survey data (2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014), choices among illegal, legal and roll-your-own cigarettes are estimated as a function of smokers’ geographical location, an indicator of illegal cigarette supply, and controlling for socioeconomic and demographic variables. Smoking behaviours in Montevideo, Durazno and Maldonado were compared with those in two border cities, Salto and Rivera, where illegal cigarette prevalence may differ. Findings An increase in taxes on manufactured legal and roll-your-own cigarettes increased the odds that smokers in cities near the borders and women switched down to illegal cigarettes. City geographical location, controls effectiveness and distribution networks may play a significant role in accessibility of illegal cigarettes. To improve the effectiveness of increased taxes and prices in reducing smoking, policy-makers may consider specific policies intended to reduce access to illegal cigarettes, such as ratification and effective implementation of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products of WHO. ","This paper provides evidence that supply and consumption of illegal cigarettes in Uruguay differ by geographical locations. The existence of distribution networks and weak controls in cities near the Uruguayan borders play a role in access to illegal cigarettes. Policies intended to reduce the supply of illegal cigarettes such as ratification and effective implementation of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade of Tobacco Products of WHO, and to some extent, taxation harmonisation among countries in the region, are needed to ensure that tobacco tax policies have the desired impact on public health.

1208,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Reliability and Stability of Puff Topography Variables in Non-Daily Smokers Assessed in the Laboratory,article,"Introduction: Puff topography variables, often measured using the Clinical Research Support System device, have traditionally been studied in regular, daily smokers and have been shown to be highly stable. However, more recent research has focused on non-daily smokers as a population of interest. As such, the aim of this article was to examine puff topography stability (cross-cigarette agreement over time) and reliability (within-cigarette consistency) in non-daily smokers across six laboratory sessions. Methods: One hundred seven non-daily smokers attended six laboratory sessions over the course of 3 months. At each session, they smoked one cigarette through the Clinical Research Support System pocket, in addition to completing questionnaires about their smoking history and dependence. Results:  Puff topography measurements were highly reliable (α values ranged from 0.87–0.95) and puff behavior was highly stable across sessions ( r values ranged from 0.38–0.84). Adding sessions substantially improved reliability estimates. Aspects of puffing behavior observed in session, including puff volume, puff duration, time of puff peak, and total cigarette volume were related to level of smoke exposure, measured by expired carbon monoxide. Instability in puffing behavior was not predicted by recent or long-term smoking patterns.  Conclusions: Puff topography appears to be a stable and routinized aspect of smoking in non-daily smokers. The feasibility of assessing puff topography in this population is supported by the high reliabilities observed, though it should be noted that reliability greatly improved by having more than one session.

2137,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Marketing Influences on Perceptions of Reduced Nicotine Content Cigarettes,article,"Introduction The Food and Drug Administration announced intent to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes. There is limited evidence on how reduced nicotine content cigarette (RNC) marketing affects product beliefs and use, and research on this is needed to inform regulations. Methods In an online experiment, 426 young adult cigarette smokers (aged 18–30 years) were randomized in a 2 (implicit: red package vs. blue package) × 2 (explicit: corrective message vs. no corrective message) design to view an advertisement for previously commercially available RNCs. Outcomes were advertisement content recall, product beliefs, and use intentions. Participants’ responses to open-ended assessment of their beliefs about the stimuli were coded to identify prevailing themes. Results Red packaging and corrective messaging were independently associated with greater advertisement content recall (p = .01 and p = .04, respectively). There were no significant main or interaction effects on product beliefs or use intentions. Controlling for condition, advertisement content recall was significantly associated with less favorable product beliefs (p < .001) and favorable product beliefs were associated with intent to use the product (p < .001). Open-ended responses converged on the finding that respondents were interested in RNCs, but expressed skepticism about effectiveness and value. Conclusions Brief exposure to an RNC advertisement with red packaging and corrective messaging were each independently associated with greater advertisement content recall. The results indicate: (1) interest and confusion among young adult smokers regarding RNCs, (2) beliefs about RNCs are influenced by marketing, and (3) beliefs are associated with intention to use RNCs. Implications Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of advertising effects on beliefs about RNC products and support the need to regulate advertising and labeling alongside product regulation. More detailed study of advertisement features that affect consumers’ beliefs about RNCs and how they impact their processing of explicit messaging about product risks will be important to guide regulatory decision-making.

814,Tobacco Control,2020,Sensory attributes of e-cigarette flavours and nicotine as mediators of interproduct differences in appeal among young adults,Research Article,"Objective To estimate the extent to which specific sensory attributes, for example, smoothness, mediate differences in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) appeal between products in non-tobacco versus tobacco flavours and varying nicotine content in young adults. Method E-cigarette users (n=100; aged 18–34 years) administered standardised two-puff e-cigarette doses of different products varying in a flavour (fruit, menthol, tobacco) × nicotine (nicotine-containing (6 mg/mL freebase), nicotine-free) within-subject design. Participants rated sensory attributes (sweetness, bitterness, smoothness and harshness) and appeal on 100-unit visual analogue scales after administering each product. Sensory ratings were tested as simultaneous mediators of flavour, nicotine and flavour × nicotine effects on appeal. Results Appeal preferences for fruit versus tobacco flavours were mediated by sweetness-enhancing (βindirect=0.092), smoothness-enhancing (βindirect=0.045) and bitterness-reducing (βindirect=0.072) effects of fruit flavours. Appeal preferences for menthol versus tobacco flavours were mediated by menthol’s smoothness-enhancing (βindirect=0.039) and bitterness-reducing (βindirect=0.034) effects. Lower appeal of nicotine-containing versus nicotine-free products was mediated by nicotine’s sweetness-reducing (βindirect=–0.036), smoothness-reducing (βindirect=–0.156) and bitterness-increasing (βindirect=0.045) effects. Flavour × nicotine interaction effects on appeal were explained by menthol-related suppression of nicotine’s bitterness-enhancing and sweetness-reducing mediation pathways and fruit-related suppression of nicotine’s bitterness-enhancing mediation pathway. Harshness did not mediate appeal after adjusting for other sensory attributes. Conclusion Bitterness and smoothness may be cross-cutting mediators of interproduct variation in the effects of types of non-tobacco flavours and nicotine on e-cigarette appeal in young adults. Sweetness may also mediate appeal-enhancing effects of fruit and appeal-reducing effects of nicotine. Non-tobacco flavours may suppress appeal-reducing effects of nicotine in e-cigarettes through attenuation of nicotine’s aversive taste attributes. ","Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in non-tobacco flavours (eg, fruit and menthol) produce greater user appeal than tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes, particularly in young populations. Nicotine in e-cigarettes generates acute aversive sensory attributes (eg, bitterness, harshness). Menthol may suppress the aversive sensory attributes of nicotine in e-cigarettes. Whether smoothness is an important sensory attribute of e-cigarettes implicated in product appeal is unknown. Whether fruit and menthol flavours, as compared with tobacco flavours, interact with nicotine to alter the aversive sensory attributes of nicotine is unknown. Whether and which sensory attributes of e-cigarette flavours and nicotine mediate interproduct differences in appeal is unknown. Among various sensory attributes of e-cigarettes that explain interproduct variation in appeal in young adults, bitterness and smoothness appear to be consistent and robust mediators of the effects of multiple flavours and nicotine on e-cigarette appeal, whereas sweetness is a robust mediator of the appeal-enhancing effects of fruit flavours, per se, and harshness does not consistently mediate interproduct differences in appeal.

",http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055172,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in non-tobacco flavours (eg, fruit and menthol) produce greater user appeal than tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes, particularly in young populations. Nicotine in e-cigarettes generates acute aversive sensory attributes (eg, bitterness, harshness). Menthol may suppress the aversive sensory attributes of nicotine in e-cigarettes. Whether smoothness is an important sensory attribute of e-cigarettes implicated in product appeal is unknown. Whether fruit and menthol flavours, as compared with tobacco flavours, interact with nicotine to alter the aversive sensory attributes of nicotine is unknown. Whether and which sensory attributes of e-cigarette flavours and nicotine mediate interproduct differences in appeal is unknown. Among various sensory attributes of e-cigarettes that explain interproduct variation in appeal in young adults, bitterness and smoothness appear to be consistent and robust mediators of the effects of multiple flavours and nicotine on e-cigarette appeal, whereas sweetness is a robust mediator of the appeal-enhancing effects of fruit flavours, per se, and harshness does not consistently mediate interproduct differences in appeal.

1829,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Randomized Trial of the Effect of Youth Appealing E-Cigarette Advertising on Susceptibility to Use E-Cigarettes Among Youth,article,"Introduction Very little is known about how e-cigarette marketing is being perceived by youth, and the potential effect it will have on youth vaping and smoking behaviors. This limits the ability to identify youth-focused marketing efforts and to design effective policies for the regulation of e-cigarette marketing content and placement. Methods A sample of 417 nonsmoking youth (mean age = 15, SD = 1.3) were randomly assigned to either view four e-cigarette ads with low youth appeal, four e-cigarette ads with high youth appeal or four control ads. After exposure, participants completed covert and overt measurements of e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette attitudes and susceptibility to use. Results Youth in an e-cigarette ad condition were more likely to select an e-cigarette item in a product choice task compared to control, and had more positive e-cigarette beliefs. Contrary to hypotheses, youth in the low youth appeal condition reported greater susceptibility to trying e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes compared to control. Conclusions Exposure to any e-cigarette advertising may play a role in teens’ decision to initiate e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette use. As the Food and Drug Administration now has regulatory authority over the marketing of e-cigarettes, regulations on e-cigarette advertising are suggested. Implications Teens are increasingly being exposed to e-cigarette advertising, and many places are considering e-cigarette regulations, yet we know very little about how e-cigarette advertisements might influence youth tobacco use. This study utilized a novel dataset of e-cigarette ads coded for youth appeal and presented them to a sample of 417 nonsmoking teens in a randomized controlled design to test the effect of features on youth susceptibility to initiating e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette use. The findings inform evidence-based recommendations for regulating the marketing of e-cigarettes.

104,Tobacco Control,2015,Cigarette price level and variation in five Southeast Asian countries,Research Article,"Objectives To monitor and analyse impacts of the interaction between tobacco excise tax policy and industry price strategy, on the price level and variation of cigarettes sold in five Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam). Methods Prices of cigarette sold by sticks and packs were collected through an in-person survey of retailers during 2011. Mean cigarette prices and price variation were calculated in each study country for single cigarettes, whole packs and brand groups. Results Price variation of whole packs was greater in countries with ad-valorem excise tax structures (Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam) than in countries with multitiered specific excise taxes (Indonesia and the Philippines). The price variation for single sticks appeared to be driven by local currency denomination. Cigarettes sold individually cost more per stick than cigarettes sold in whole packs in every brand group except for Indonesia's domestic brands. Conclusions Tobacco industry strategy and excise tax structure drove the price level and variation of cigarettes sold in packs, while currency denominations influence the selling price of single sticks. To maximise the effectiveness of tobacco tax policies, countries should adopt specific excise tax structures to decrease cigarette price variation, which would minimise opportunities for smokers to ‘trade down’ to a cheaper brand to avoid a tax-driven price increase.

246,Tobacco Control,2016,The impact of tobacco expenditures on spending within Turkish households,Research Article,"Purpose The aim of this study is to determine whether tobacco spending has a ‘crowding out’ effect on food and utility spending within Turkish households. It also examines whether tobacco control policies have caused the spending patterns of smoking households to become similar to those of non-smoking households. Methods Using 2007 and 2011 Turkish Household Budget Surveys, we estimated the Quadratic Conditional Engel Curve (QCEC) to determine household spending patterns. The QCEC was estimated using the Three-Stage Least Square (3SLS) method with instrumental variables. Results In Turkey, smoking households spend nearly 8% of their monthly budgets on smoking, while the expenditures of non-smoking households on food, utilities and housing average 9% more than those of smoking households. For both years studied, a crowding out effect was demonstrated whereby smoking expenditure results in decreased household expenditure on food, housing, durable/non-durable goods and education. Conclusions In Turkey, households including at least one smoker spend nearly 8% of their monthly budget on tobacco, with a converse reduction in spending on food and utilities. While tobacco control policies (eg, increasing taxes on tobacco products and extending smoking bans) have decreased tobacco consumption, these policies have had limited impact on the spending patterns of smoking households. ","This study shows that, in Turkey, expenditures on tobacco crowd out spending on other goods. Smoking households allocated 8% less of their monthly budgets for certain commodities (eg, food, housing, durable/non-durable goods and utilities) than non-smoking households in each year. Tobacco expenditures have a statistically significant impact on these differences. Tobacco control policies were successful in many aspects across the time period studied; however, changes in the spending patterns of smoking households in response to these policies have been limited.

1863,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Patterns and Correlates of Multiple Tobacco Product Use in the United States,article,"The emergence of new tobacco products in the marketplace over the past several years has contributed to changing patterns of tobacco use in the United States (US). Approximately 40% of youth and adult tobacco users in the US used multiple tobacco products (polytobacco use) in 2013–2014. Diverse factors associated with polytobacco use in the US include younger age, male sex, lower levels of educational attainment, binge-drinking, prior quit attempts, later onset of first tobacco use, first use of tobacco being a noncombustible tobacco product, and high sensation-seeking. Different factors may be associated with different polytobacco use patterns, as suggested by an analysis of 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) data that found that as the number of tobacco products used increased, nicotine dependence and perceived peer tobacco use increased and quit intentions decreased. Some combinations of tobacco product use may be driven by addiction or experimentation, whereas other combinations, such as cigarettes with electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or smokeless tobacco, may reflect partial substitution of cigarettes with another product perceived as less harmful or as a tool for circumventing smoke free laws.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/nty081,,"Stanton, Cassandra A; Halenar, Michael J","Westat, Rockville, MD Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC Westat, Rockville, MD"
1993,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Agonists for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Dementia: An Update,article," A significant portion of the clinical phenotype observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) occurs through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Degeneration of cholinergic neurons, combined with aberrant nAChR expression and activation partially through amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ)–nAChR leads to upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways and subsequently the progressive cognitive decline of AD. Interestingly, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is also mediated through nAChR particularly α7 nAChR. Thus, agonists of these receptors will likely exert pro-cognitive benefits through multiple mechanisms including stimulating the cholinergic pathway, modulating inflammation, and buffering the effects of amyloid. Despite this promising theoretical use, trials thus far have been complicated by adverse effects or minimal improvement. This review will provide an update on several pharmacological nAChR agonists tested in clinical trials and reasons that further investigation of nAChR agonists is merited. Implications nAChRs have consistently presented a promising theoretical use in the treatment of AD; however, trials thus far have been complicated by adverse effects or minimal improvement.

1624,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Combination Varenicline/Bupropion Treatment Benefits Highly Dependent Smokers in an Adaptive Smoking Cessation Paradigm,article,"Introduction This study replicated and extended results of a previous trial, which found that combination varenicline/bupropion treatment increased smoking abstinence in smokers who were male, highly dependent, and who did not respond to prequit nicotine patch treatment with a >50% reduction in expired-air carbon monoxide in the first week. Methods One hundred and twenty-two male nicotine patch nonresponders and 52 responders were identified. Smokers in each group were randomized to receive 12 weeks of varenicline plus bupropion treatment versus varenicline plus placebo. The primary outcome was continuous smoking abstinence at weeks 8–11 after the target quit date. Results For smokers with a high level of dependence, judged by having a baseline Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score ≥ 6 and cigarette consumption ≥ 20/d, combination varenicline/bupropion treatment increased the abstinence rate relative to varenicline alone: 71.0% versus 43.8% (odds ratio = 3.14; 95% confidence interval = 1.11–8.92, p [one tailed] = .016). In contrast, less dependent smokers did not show a benefit of combination treatment relative to varenicline (abstinence rates of 32.1% vs. 45.6%, respectively); there was a significant interaction of treatment and dependence level. Patch nonresponders tended to benefit the most from combination treatment, which was well tolerated overall. Conclusions Combination varenicline/bupropion treatment proved significantly more efficacious than varenicline alone among highly dependent male smokers. These results, together with prior studies, support an adaptive treatment paradigm that assigns smoking cessation treatment according to baseline smoker characteristics and initial response to nicotine patch treatment. Implications This study replicated, in a prospective manner, an important and surprising retrospective finding from a previous clinical trial, which showed that a specific subpopulation of smokers benefited substantially from receiving a combination treatment of varenicline plus bupropion, relative to varenicline plus placebo. Specifically, male smokers having high baseline nicotine dependence (FTND score ≥ 6 and cigarette consumption ≥ 20/d), showed a marked increase in smoking abstinence rate on combination pharmacotherapy. The present study likewise found an enhancement in end-of-treatment abstinence rate in this subgroup, from 43.8% to 71.0%. The adaptive treatment paradigm, which classifies smokers based on initial dependence level and response to prequit nicotine patch treatment, may be used to identify target populations of smokers whose success can be enhanced by intervening with combination pharmacotherapy before the quit-smoking date.

2145,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Extended Nicotine Patch Treatment Among Smokers With and Without Comorbid Psychopathology,article,"Introduction Individuals with psychiatric conditions smoke at higher rates than the general population and may need more intensive treatment to quit. We examined whether or not extended treatment with nicotine patch, combined with behavior counseling, would disproportionally benefit smokers with versus without a lifetime psychiatric condition. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from an effectiveness trial of treatment with 12 counseling sessions (48 weeks) and 21-mg nicotine patch (8, 24, or 52 weeks) among 525 adult daily smokers. A structured clinical interview assessed past and current psychiatric disorders (major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse and/or dependence, and substance abuse and/or dependence), as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition). Abstinence was bioverified at week 52. Logistic regression evaluated the effect of the psychiatric status × treatment duration interaction on abstinence at week 52, covarying for sociodemographics, baseline psychological symptoms, and treatment adherence. Results At baseline, 115 (21.9%) participants were diagnosed with one or more psychiatric conditions. The psychiatric status × treatment duration interaction was significant for week 52 abstinence (p = .027). Abstinence rates between smokers with versus without a psychiatric condition in the 24-week treatment arm (9.3% vs. 31.5% abstinent) significantly differed from the 8-week treatment arm (18.8% vs. 22.3%), p = .017. Abstinence rates for smokers with (22.5%) versus without a psychiatric condition (19.7%) in the 52-week treatment arm did not differ from those in the 8-week arm. Conclusions Targeted smoking cessation treatment, rather than extending treatment duration, may be especially warranted to optimize treatment for smokers with comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Implications Individuals with psychiatric conditions smoke at higher rates and have greater difficulty quitting compared to those in the general population, but little is known about how to best optimize treatment for this high tobacco burden population. The present study found that cessation response to extended duration treatment with the transdermal nicotine patch did not differ for smokers with versus without comorbid anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders in a large-scale clinical effectiveness trial. Development of targeted behavioral treatments may be required to optimize abstinence outcomes for this high-risk population, rather than simply extending the duration of pharmacotherapy treatments.

1126,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Tobacco Pricing in Military Stores: Views of Military Policy Leaders,article,"Introduction: Higher tobacco taxes reduce tobacco use. On military installations, cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold tax-free, keeping prices artificially low. Pricing regulations in the military specify that tobacco should be within 5% of the local most competitive price, but prices still average almost 13% lower than those at local Walmarts. Methods:  To gain insight into policy leaders’ ideas and positions on military tobacco pricing, we interviewed members of the Department of Defense (DoD) Addictive Substances Misuse Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Tobacco about tobacco pricing policies ( n = 12).  Results: Participants frequently lacked specific knowledge of details of military pricing policy, and the impact higher prices might have on military tobacco use. Most participants thought tobacco should not be sold at military stores, but many also felt that this policy change was unlikely due to tobacco industry pressure, and DoD reliance on tobacco profits to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation funds. Conclusions: Achieving a tobacco-free military will require changing pricing policy, but this study suggests that for effective implementation, military leadership must also understand and articulate more clearly the rationale for doing so. Implications: Previous work has found that adherence to military tobacco pricing policy is inconsistent at best. This study suggests that lack of knowledge about the policy and conflicting pressures resulting from the funding stream tobacco sales represent extend to high level military policy leaders. Without clearer information and direction, these leaders are unlikely to be able to establish and implement better tobacco pricing policy.

697,Tobacco Control,2019,Observed retail price of Australia’s market-leading cigarette brand before and up to 3 years after the implementation of plain packaging,Research Article,"Objective Despite claims by tobacco companies that plain packaging would lead to lower cigarette prices, recommended and observed real cigarette prices in Australia rose in the 9–11 months after plain packaging was introduced. However, little is known about trends in prices longer term. In this report, we assess whether inflation (Consumer Price Index; CPI) and tax adjusted (‘CPI-tax-adjusted’) prices of the market-leading Australian cigarette brand changed in the 3-year period after plain packaging, and whether price changes were associated with retailer characteristics. Method Cigarette prices were ascertained from a panel of tobacco retailers at three time points: (1) in November 2012 (n=857) (before full implementation of plain packaging, compulsory in retail outlets from December 2012), (2) between October 2014 and February 2015 (n=789) and (3) between November 2015 and March 2016 (n=579). Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate percentage change in mean CPI/tax-adjusted cigarette prices over time. Results CPI/tax-adjusted adjusted mean stick prices rose by 13.7% (95% CI 13.0 to 16.0) and 15.2% (95% CI 14.3 to 16.0) at 2.1 and 3.1 years after plain packaging was introduced, respectively. Increases in mean CPI/tax-adjusted stick prices varied by outlet type (p<0.001), socioeconomic status (p=0.013) and remoteness of retailer’s area (p=0.028) and whether twin packs were sold (p=0.009). Conclusions Contrary to tobacco company predictions of a fall in prices, the price of the market-leading Australian cigarette brand increased significantly in the 3 years after plain packaging was introduced, and these increases were above the combined effects of inflation and increases in excise/customs duty. ","Tobacco companies have argued that plain packaging would result in substantial falls in tobacco prices which, if true, would undermine efforts to discourage smoking using tax-driven price rises. Previous research has shown that recommended and observed cigarette prices did not fall (and in fact rose, even after adjustment for inflation) in the 9–11 months after implementation of plain packaging in Australia. However, that research leaves open the possibility that prices fell over a longer time period. These results show no support for tobacco companies’ claims that plain packaging would result in a decrease in tobacco prices. Instead, the price of the leading brand of cigarettes in Australia increased significantly over the 3-year period after plain packaging implementation, after adjusting for tax and inflation.

1565,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Smoking Cessation for Pregnant Smokers: Development and Pilot Test of an Emotion Regulation Treatment Supplement to Standard Smoking Cessation for Negative Affect Smokers,article,"Introduction: Negative affect has been identified as a factor influencing continued smoking during pregnancy. In this study, a multi-component emotion regulation intervention was developed to address negative emotional smoking triggers and pilot-tested among low-income pregnant smokers. Treatment feasibility and acceptability, cotinine-verified rates of smoking cessation, and self-report of mean cigarettes smoked were assessed. Methods: Pregnant smokers who self-reported smoking in response to negative affect (N = 70) were randomly assigned to receive one of two 8-session interventions: (1) emotion regulation treatment combined with standard cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation (ERT + CBT) or (2) a health and lifestyle plus standard smoking cessation active control (HLS + CBT). Outcomes for the 4-month period following the quit date are reported. Results: Treatment attendance and subjective ratings provide evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of the ERT + CBT intervention. Compared with the HLS + CBT control condition, the ERT + CBT condition demonstrated higher abstinence rates at 2 months (ERT + CBT = 23% vs. HLS + CBT = 0%, OR = 13.51; 95% CI = 0.70–261.59) and 4 months (ERT = 18% vs. HLS = 5%; OR = 2.98; 95% CI = 0.39–22.72) post-quit. Mean number of cigarettes per day was significantly lower in ERT + CBT at 2 months (ERT + CBT = 2.73 (3.35) vs. HLS + CBT = 5.84 (6.24); p = .05) but not at 4 months (ERT + CBT = 2.15 (3.17) vs. HLS + CBT = 5.18 (2.88); p = .06) post-quit. Conclusions: The development and initial test of the ERT + CBT intervention supports its feasibility and acceptability in this difficult-to-treat population. Further development and testing in a Stage II randomized clinical trial are warranted. Implications: Negative affect has been identified as a motivator for continued smoking during pregnancy. To date, smoking cessation interventions for pregnant smokers have not specifically addressed the role of negative affect as a smoking trigger. This treatment development pilot study provides support for the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component ERT + CBT for low-income pregnant smokers who self-report smoking in response to negative affect.

1149,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Structured Smoking Cessation Training for Medical Students: A Prospective Study,article,"Introduction: Physician adherence to guideline recommendations regarding the provision of counseling and support for smokers willing to quit is low. A lack of training during undergraduate medical education has been identified as a potential cause. This prospective intervention study evaluated a novel teaching module for medical students. Methods: As part of a 6-week cardiovascular course, 125 fourth-year undergraduate medical students received a multimodal and interactive teaching module on smoking cessation, including online learning material, lectures, seminars, and practical skills training. Short- and medium-term effects on knowledge, skills, attitudes, and self-reported practice were measured using written examinations and an objective structured clinical examination at the end of the module and 6 months later. Results were compared to data obtained from a historical control cohort (n = 70) unexposed to the intervention. Results: At the 6-month follow-up, scores in the knowledge test were significantly higher in the intervention than the control group (61.1% vs. 51.7%; p < .001). A similar pattern was observed in the objective structured clinical examination (71.5% vs. 60.5%; p < .001). More students in the intervention than control group agreed that smoking was a chronic disease (83.1% vs. 68.1%; p = .045). The control group was more likely to report recording smoking status (p = .018), but no group difference was detected regarding the report of advising to quit (p = .154). Conclusions: A novel teaching module for undergraduate medical students produced a sustained learning outcome in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes but not self-reported practice. Implications: Studies across the world have identified considerable knowledge gaps and deficits in practical training with regard to smoking cessation counseling in undergraduate medical students. This paper describes a teaching intervention informed by current recommendations for the design of educational activities aimed at enabling medical students to deliver adequate behavior change counseling. The teaching module was tailored to the needs of a specific healthcare system. Given its effectiveness as demonstrated in this prospective study, a rollout of this intervention in medical schools might have the potential to substantially improve medical students’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes in relation to smoking cessation counseling.

1294,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Multifaceted Strategy to Implement Brief Smoking Cessation Counseling During Antenatal Care in Argentina and Uruguay: A Cluster Randomized Trial,article,"Introduction: Argentina and Uruguay have a high prevalence of smoking during pregnancy. However, and despite national recommendations, pregnant women are not routinely receiving cessation counseling during antenatal care (ANC). We evaluated a multifaceted strategy designed to increase the frequency of pregnant women who received a brief smoking cessation counseling based on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange). Methods: We randomly assigned (1:1) 20 ANC clusters in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay to receive a multifaceted intervention to implement brief smoking cessation counseling into routine ANC, or to receive no intervention. The primary outcome was the frequency of women who recalled receiving the 5As during ANC at more than one visit. Frequency of women who smoked until the end of pregnancy, and attitudes and readiness of ANC providers towards providing counseling were secondary outcomes. Women’s outcomes were measured at baseline and at the end of the 14- to 18-month intervention, by administering questionnaires at the postpartum hospital stay. Self-reported cessation was verified with saliva cotinine. The trial took place between October 03, 2011 and November 29, 2013. Results:  The rate of women who recalled receiving the 5As increased from 14.0% to 33.6% in the intervention group (median rate change, 22.1%), and from 10.8% to 17.0% in the control group (median rate change, 4.6%; P = .001 for the difference in change between groups). The effect of the intervention was larger in Argentina than in Uruguay. The proportion of women who continued smoking during pregnancy was unchanged at follow-up in both groups and the relative difference between groups was not statistically significant (ratio of odds ratios 1.16, 95% CI: 0.98–1.37; P = .086). No significant changes were observed in knowledge, attitudes, and self-confidence of ANC providers.  Conclusions: The intervention showed a moderate effect in increasing the proportion of women who recalled receiving the 5As, with a third of women receiving counseling in more than one visit. However, the frequency of women who smoked until the end of the pregnancy was not significantly reduced by the intervention. Implications: No implementation trials of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women have been carried out in Latin American or in middle-income countries where health care systems or capacities may differ. We evaluated a multifaceted strategy designed to increase the frequency of pregnant women who receive brief smoking cessation counseling based on the 5As in Argentina and Uruguay. We found that the intervention showed a moderate effect in increasing the proportion of women receiving the 5As, with a third of women receiving counseling in more than one visit. However, the frequency of women who smoked until the end of the pregnancy was not significantly reduced by the intervention.

770,Tobacco Control,2020,Adolescents’ perceptions of tobacco accessibility and smoking norms and attitudes in response to the tobacco point-of-sale display ban in Scotland: results from the DISPLAY Study,Research Article,"Background Scotland implemented a ban on open display of tobacco products in supermarkets in April 2013, and small shops in April 2015. This study aimed to quantify changes in perceived tobacco accessibility, smoking norms and smoking attitudes among adolescents in Scotland, following the implementation of partial and comprehensive point-of-sale (POS) tobacco display bans. Methods From the Determining the Impact of Smoking Point of Sale Legislation Among Youth (DISPLAY) Study’s 2013–2017 annual surveys we retrieved data comprising 6202 observations on 4836 12–17-year-old adolescents from four schools. Applying generalised estimating equations, associations between time (postban: 2016–2017 vs preban:2013) and three outcomes were estimated. Outcomes were perceived commercial access to tobacco, perceived positive smoking norm (friends think it’s OK to smoke) and positive smoking attitude (you think it’s OK to smoke). Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, smoking status, family smoking, friend smoking and e-cigarette use. Results Crude trends showed an increase over time in perceived accessibility, norms and attitudes. However, after adjustment for confounders, mainly e-cigarette use, we found significant declines in perceived access (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.90) and in positive smoking attitude (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.91), but no change in perceived positive smoking norm (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29). Current/past occasional or regular e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of perceived access (OR = 3.12, 95% CI 2.32 to 4.21), positive norm (OR = 2.94, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.02) and positive attitude (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 2.35 to 4.87). Conclusion Only when taking into account that the use of e-cigarettes increased in 2013–2017 did we find that the POS tobacco display ban in supermarkets and small shops in Scotland was followed by reductions in adolescents’ perceived accessibility of tobacco and positive attitudes towards smoking. ","Tobacco displays at the point-of-sale (POS) remain an important marketing tool for the tobacco industry to target young people. Among Scottish adolescents, 80% reported having seen tobacco displays before implementation of a POS tobacco display ban and the impact of such a ban is therefore potentially substantial. Few studies to date have evaluated the impact of removing POS tobacco displays on adolescents, and existing studies have not assessed changes in adolescents’ perceptions of the acceptability of smoking. Scotland implemented a display ban in two phases in 2013 and 2015, and this natural experiment provides important evidence for other countries on the importance of display bans for tobacco control in general, and youth smoking prevention in particular. The POS tobacco display ban in supermarkets and small shops in Scotland was followed by reductions in adolescents’ perceived accessibility of tobacco and positive attitude towards smoking, but only after taking into account that the use of e-cigarettes increased between 2013 and 2017.

Although the meta-analysis found that “exposure to prenatal smoke increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29%” (p. 3), the authors noted that “familial confounding may explain some of the observed association” (p. 8). We agree with the importance of this alternative hypothesis. In fact, we were surprised that the review did not consider the results of sibling comparison studies that have directly addressed it, particularly given that the review had the opportunity to do so using data from articles included in the meta-analysis. As we illustrate below—and as has been discussed previously—we are concerned that limiting the focus of the review to only findings potentially subject to familial confounding rather than incorporating these sibling comparison results may lead to inaccurate inferences from the reviewed literature.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa058,,"Quinn, Patrick D; Meier, Sandra M; D’Onofrio, Brian M","Department of Applied Health Science, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN Department of Psychiatry, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"
1439,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Daily Smoking and Subjective Health Complaints in Adolescence,article,"Introduction: Using data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey, this study used a repeated cross-sectional design to examine associations between daily smoking, gender, and self-reported health complaints in five cohorts of adolescents over a 16-year period. Methods: Data were from nationally representative cohorts of 15-year-old youth in Norway in 1993/1994, 1997/1998, 2001/2002, 2005/2006, and 2009/2010 (ntotal = 7761). Dependent variables were psychological, somatic, and total health complaints. A mixed GLM model examined main and interaction effects of smoking (daily, intermittent, nonsmoking), year, and gender in predicting complaints. Time periods were segmented to compare trends across smoking groups in specific periods. Results: Prevalence of daily smoking declined from 15.5% (1993/1994) to 6.0% (2009/2010). All health complaint scores were significantly higher for smokers and for girls (vs. boys). Smoking status by year interactions were significant for all complaint variables during the period of sharpest decline of daily smoking prevalence (2001/2002–2005/2006), with daily smokers experiencing increases in health complaints while intermittent and nonsmokers did not. Smoking status by gender interactions were significant for all health complaint variables, indicating that the main effect for gender (females higher) was even stronger among smokers compared with nonsmokers. Using year as unit of analysis, the size of mean differences between daily smokers and intermittent/nonsmokers in total complaints was significantly negatively correlated with daily smoking prevalence (−.963, n = 5, p < .01). Conclusions: As prevalence of daily smoking declined, daily smokers reported higher levels of complaints, suggesting increasing health problems within this group. Girls who smoke daily had particularly elevated levels of complaints. Implications: This study indicates that the relationship between daily smoking and concurrent health symptomatology in adolescents is changing over time, with higher levels of health complaints reported as overall smoking prevalence declines. To our knowledge, this finding has not previously been reported. If youth are smoking to cope with distress, pain, or other health concerns, tobacco control objectives will be increasingly difficult to achieve with adolescents. Levels of health complaints are particularly high among girls who are daily smokers. The findings suggest that restrictive measures and persuasive communications may not be sufficient tobacco prevention strategies for adolescent populations. Young smokers may need counseling and support.

599,Tobacco Control,2019,Vaping versus JUULing: how the extraordinary growth and marketing of JUUL transformed the US retail e-cigarette market,Research Article,"Background While national surveys showed declines in e-cigarette use in the USA between 2015 and 2016, recent reports indicate that JUUL, a sleekly designed e-cigarette that looks like a USB drive, is increasingly being used by youth and young adults. However, the extent of JUUL’s growth and its marketing strategy have not been systematically examined. Methods A variety of data sources were used to examine JUUL retail sales in the USA and its marketing and promotion. Retail store scanner data were used to capture the retail sales of JUUL and other major e-cigarette brands for the period 2011–2017. A list of JUUL-related keywords was used to identify JUUL-related tweets on Twitter; to identify JUUL-related posts, hashtags and accounts on Instagram and to identify JUUL-related videos on YouTube. Results In the short 3-year period 2015–2017, JUUL has transformed from a little-known brand with minimum sales into the largest retail e-cigarette brand in the USA, lifting sales of the entire e-cigarette category. Its US$150 million retail sales in the last quarter of 2017 accounted for about 40% of e-cigarette retail market share. While marketing expenditures for JUUL were moderate, the sales growth of JUUL was accompanied by a variety of innovative, engaging and wide-reaching campaigns on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, conducted by JUUL and its affiliated marketers. Conclusions The discrepancies between e-cigarette sales data and the prevalence of e-cigarette use from surveys highlight the challenges in tracking and understanding the use of new and emerging tobacco products. In a rapidly changing media environment, where successful and influential marketing campaigns can be conducted on social media at little cost, marketing expenditures alone may not fully capture the influence, reach and engagement of tobacco marketing. ","Recent nationally representative surveys indicate declines in e-cigarette use between 2015 and 2016 in the USA. However, these surveys may have failed to capture the use of a relatively new product, JUUL. We systematically document the extent and rate of growth in JUUL retail sales and market share since the product’s debut in mid-2015.

Methods Nationally representative data from the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey were used (n=3504). Frequencies and weighted proportions were calculated for seeing any corrective statement and for each of the five court-ordered corrective statements. Weighted, multivariable logistic regression was used to examine sociodemographic and smoking status predictors of reported exposure to any corrective statement. Results In 2018, an estimated 40.6% of US adults had seen messages in newspapers or on television in the past 6 months stating that a federal court has ordered tobacco companies to make statements about the dangers of smoking cigarettes. Reported exposure to topic-specific statements ranged from 11.4% (manipulation of cigarette design) to 34.7% (health effects). Those with a high school education were significantly less likely than those with a college degree to report seeing the statements (OR=0.69, CI 0.50 to 0.95) and current smokers were significantly more likely than never smokers to report seeing them (OR=1.68, CI 1.12 to 2.53). Conclusions In the first 6 months of corrective statement implementation, an estimated 40.6% of US adults reported at least one exposure to any corrective statement, and current smokers were more likely than never smokers to report exposure. Traditional media channels can be effective for tobacco-related message dissemination; however, they may fail to reach more than half of the adult population without additional targeted communication efforts. ","Some work has been done to describe or evaluate the current or earlier, proposed versions of the corrective statements in forced-exposure/aided recall studies.

120,Tobacco Control,2015,Clove cigar sales following the US flavoured cigarette ban,Research Article,"Background Following the passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, flavoured cigarettes, including clove cigarettes, were banned based on the rationale that such cigarettes appealed to youth. However, the ban on characterising flavours was not extended to cigars. Methods This study reviewed industry documents from Kretek International, the parent company behind Djarum clove cigars, to document the changes in their marketing and production strategies following the flavour ban on cigarettes. To assess sales trends following the ban, data for clove cigar sales in the USA from 2009 to 2012 were analysed using Nielsen's Convenience Track retail scanner database. Additionally, data on tobacco imports to the USA from Indonesia were obtained from the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service’s Global Agricultural Trade System for the years 2008–2012. Results In anticipation of Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) flavour ban on cigarettes and recognising the regulatory advantages of cigars, Kretek International began developing Djarum clove cigars in 2007. Immediately following the flavour ban, sales of this product increased by more than 1400% between 2009 and 2012. During this same period, tobacco imports to the USA from Indonesia, a leader in clove tobacco production, shifted from cigarettes to almost exclusively cigars. Conclusions Kretek International, like other tobacco manufacturers, manipulated its products following the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act as a way to capitalise on regulatory loopholes and replace its now banned clove cigarettes. As a result, consumption of the company's Djarum clove cigars increased exponentially in recent years. ","In September 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of candy-flavoured, fruit-flavoured and clove-flavoured cigarettes. In response to the FDA ban, Kretek International developed and marketed the Djarum clove cigar to replace their popular clove cigarettes. This paper offers a discussion of Kretek's internal documents detailing the introduction of their clove-flavoured filtered cigar and analyses market scanner and import data to examine clove cigar consumption. Based on our analysis, Kretek International prepared a replacement cigar product well in advance of the FDA legislation on flavoured cigarettes and has demonstrated strong growth potential in shifting from clove cigarettes to clove cigars. We argue that failing to extend the flavour ban to cigars has created opportunity for new products to replace flavoured cigarettes and may undermine the FDA's goal to reduce youth smoking and protect public health.

1635,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Cigarette Nicotine Content as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Negative Affect and Smoking,article,"Introduction Research suggests a strong association between negative affect (NA) and smoking. However, little is known about the association between NA and smoking among individuals who switch to reduced-nicotine cigarettes. The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which cigarette nicotine content moderates the relationship between NA and smoking over time. Methods Seven hundred and seventeen participants, 237 in the normal nicotine content (NNC; 15.8 mg/g and usual brand) cigarette group and 480 in the very low nicotine content (VLNC; 2.4 mg/g nicotine or less) cigarette group, participated in a randomized trial that examined the effects of cigarette nicotine content on smoking behavior over 6 weeks. We used parallel process latent growth curve modeling to estimate the relationship between changes in NA and changes in the numbers of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), from baseline to 6 weeks, as a function of cigarette nicotine content. Results The relationship between NA and investigational CPD reduced over time for those in the VLNC group, but not for those in the NNC group. There was no significant relationship between change in PA and CPD over time for either cigarette group. Conclusions Smoking VLNC cigarettes disrupts the relationship between smoking and negative affect, which may help reduce nicotine dependence. Implications This study suggests that the association between NA and smoking behavior is reduced over time among those that smoked reduced-nicotine content cigarettes. This provides additional evidence that smoking reduced-nicotine content cigarettes may help reduce nicotine dependence.

1081,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Assessing and Predicting Susceptibility to Waterpipe Tobacco Use Among College Students,article,"Introduction: College youth susceptible to waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) represent an important target to intervene upon in order to prevent their uptake of this product. This study examined the performance of a 4-item susceptibility measure to WTS to predict future waterpipe use and correlates of susceptibility. Methods: A cohort of college students from 11 university campuses in North Carolina and Virginia completed an online survey in 2012 and again in 2013 that assessed WTS susceptibility and subsequent waterpipe use. Tobacco use, marijuana use, binge drinking, and sensation seeking were also assessed. Results: Overall, 964 students who reported having never used waterpipe tobacco in 2012 completed the online surveys both years. Overall, about 27% of college youth were susceptible to WTS each year. Participants susceptible in 2012 were 2.5 times more likely to report having used waterpipe tobacco the subsequent year than non-susceptible participants after controlling for significant correlates of waterpipe use. Correlates of susceptibility were: being male, past 30 day cigarette smoking, use of other tobacco products, binge drinking and marijuana use, as well as higher sensation seeking. Conclusions: A 4-item WTS susceptibility measure predicts future WTS. This measure can be used to identify and intervene upon susceptible college youth to curb further exploration of WTS. Indeed, a nontrivial proportion of college students found susceptible go on to use waterpipe tobacco within a year.

Methods We used the data from the Spanish National Health Surveys (2003, 2006, and 2011) to obtain information about current and former smoking. We reconstructed annual smoking rates from 1989 through 2011 by sex and 5-year age groups. The prevalence were projected for the period 2012–2025 using a Bayesian logistic binomial model and estimated the probability to achieve the 30% relative reduction endorsed by the WHO. We calculated the 95% credible interval (CrI) of the posterior distribution, which includes a 95% of the distribution of potential smoking prevalences. Results In men, the projections show a decline for crude (−2.64% annually, 95% CrI: −3.32; −1.97) and adjusted (−2.50%, 95% CrI:−3.14; −1.87) prevalence. In women, the projections show a decline for crude prevalence (−0.36%, 95% CrI: −1.02; −0.30)) and the age-adjusted prevalence (−1.02%, 95% CrI: −1.61, −0.47). By age groups, the decline is greater among women aged 15–39 years (−3.92%, 95% CrI: −4.92; −2.96)) while for women aged 40–64 years an increase (1.84%, 95% CrI: 1.06; 2.58) is expected. In men, the probability to achieve the WHO target is 0.728 and in women is less than 0.001. The age group 15–39 shows the highest probability to achieve the target. Conclusions The results suggest smoking prevalence will decrease during 2012–2025 in all age groups for both sexes except for women aged 40–64. We found that the WHO target of a 30% reduction in prevalence is likely to be achieved overall and in the 15–39 years age groups for both sexes, but not achieved for older women and it is uncertain whether it will be achieved for older men. These results highlight the need to strengthen public health interventions that focus on reducing tobacco use in adult women aged 40–64 years old. Implications We project a decrease in smoking prevalence in during 2012–2025 except for women aged 40–64.

1319,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Low-Cost Air Quality Monitoring Methods to Assess Compliance With Smoke-Free Regulations: A Multi-Center Study in Six Low- and Middle-Income Countries,article,"Introduction: Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have enacted legislation banning smoking in public places, yet enforcement remains challenging. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a validated low-cost methodology (the Dylos DC1700) to provide objective evidence of smoke-free (SF) law compliance in hospitality venues in urban LMIC settings, where outdoor air pollution levels are generally high. Methods:  Teams measured indoor fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations and systematically observed smoking behavior and SF signage in a convenience sample of hospitality venues (bars, restaurants, cafes, and hotels) covered by existing SF legislation in Mexico, Pakistan, Indonesia, Chad, Bangladesh, and India. Outdoor air PM 2.5 was also measured on each sampling day.  Results:  Data were collected from 626 venues. Smoking was observed during almost one-third of visits with substantial differences between countries—from 5% in India to 72% in Chad. After excluding venues where other combustion sources were observed, secondhand smoke (SHS) derived PM 2.5 was calculated by subtracting outdoor ambient PM 2.5 concentrations from indoor measurements and was, on average, 34 µg/m 3 in venues with observed smoking—compared to an average value of 0 µg/m 3 in venues where smoking was not observed ( P < .001). In over one-quarter of venues where smoking was observed the difference between indoor and outdoor PM 2.5 concentrations exceeded 64 µg/m 3 .  Conclusions: This study suggests that low-cost air quality monitoring is a viable method for improving knowledge about environmental SHS and can provide indicative data on compliance with local and national SF legislation in hospitality venues in LMICs. Implications: Air quality monitoring can provide objective scientific data on SHS and air quality levels in venues to assess the effectiveness of SF laws and identify required improvements. Equipment costs and high outdoor air pollution levels have hitherto limited application in LMICs. This study tested the feasibility of using a validated low-cost methodology in hospitality venues in six LMIC urban settings and suggests this is a viable method for improving knowledge about SHS exposure and can provide indicative data on compliance with SF legislation.

2383,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Use of Electronic Cigarettes and Self-Reported Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Diagnosis in Adults,article,"Introduction Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use (vaping) has increased in recent years. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death associated with smoking. Aims and Methods Based on 2016 and 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System national survey data on 891 242 adult participants who indicated their smoking and vaping status, the cross-sectional association of vaping with self-reported COPD diagnosis was investigated, using univariable and multivariable weighted logistic regression models. Results Compared to never users, while dual users showed the highest association with self-reported COPD diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.98 to 4.85), current vapers who were either ex-smokers or never smoked showed significantly higher association with self-reported COPD diagnosis (aOR = 3.24; 95% CI = 2.78 to 3.78 and aOR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.01 to 2.12, respectively). Current vapers who were ex-smokers showed higher association with self-reported COPD diagnosis than ex-smokers who do not vape (aOR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.48). Dual users showed higher association with self-reported COPD diagnosis than current smokers who do not vape (aOR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.27). Ex-smokers showed significantly less association with self-reported COPD diagnosis (aOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.71) than current smokers. Current vapers who were either ex-smokers or never smoked had less association with self-reported COPD diagnosis compared to current smokers, with aOR = 0.85 (95% CI = 0.73 to 0.99) and aOR = 0.39 (95% CI = 0.27 to 0.56). Conclusions Vaping is significantly associated with self-reported COPD diagnosis in adults, even among vapers who never smoked. Whether there is a benefit for COPD of switching from smoking to vaping requires study of the long-term effects of vaping. Implications With the increase of e-cigarette use in recent years, the health effects of e-cigarettes need to be investigated. While several studies have examined the association of vaping with respiratory symptoms among adolescents, little is known about the association of vaping with susceptibility to COPD among US adults. Using cross-sectional national survey data in adults, our study showed that vaping was significantly associated with self-reported COPD diagnosis. Although our data did not establish the causal relationship between vaping and self-reported COPD diagnosis, this study raises concerns about the observed association between vaping and self-reported COPD diagnosis.

1864,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,"Cigarettes, Little Cigars, and Cigarillos: Initiation, Motivation, and Decision-Making",article,"Introduction Cigarettes and little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs) are the most prevalent dual-use tobacco combination; one-third of cigarette smokers use LCCs. Risk factors for multiple tobacco product use have been reported; however, there is little understanding of why some individuals transition to and maintain multiple product use. In this study, we examine narratives of tobacco product initiation and decision-making among LCC-only and LCC-cigarette smokers. Methods We audio-recorded in-depth interviews with 60 individuals, aged 14–28, who reported smoking more than or equal to 1 cigarillo per week; half also smoked cigarettes. Transcribed interviews were coded using a phenomenological approach to examine themes about smoking initiation, motivation, and product decision-making. Results Among dual users, 60% began smoking LCCs before or at the same time as cigarettes, and 40% began smoking cigarettes first. Reasons for smoking cigarettes in addition to LCCs included easier access when experiencing craving and less time to smoke the product. Cigarette smokers reported first smoking LCCs in social contexts when sharing LCCs with other smokers, or when they could afford a single LCC but not a pack of cigarettes. LCC-only smokers reported not smoking cigarettes because of their expense, unpleasant taste and/or smell, and fear of becoming addicted. Conclusions In this sample of current LCC users, half also used cigarettes. Product initiation order was almost evenly split, but reasons for initiating the second product differed, with immediacy of reducing cravings as a key reason for LCC users to smoke a cigarette and social and financial reasons for cigarette users to smoke an LCC. Implications Understanding how and why dual use is initiated and sustained can inform policies to help prevent increased nicotine dependence and initiation of additional tobacco products. This study demonstrates that the beliefs, perceptions, and practices of LCC-only and dual users inform their product selection. Our findings point to the need to apply the strategies that have been effective at decreasing cigarette consumption to LCCs.

451,Tobacco Control,2018,Seven years of progress in tobacco control: an evaluation of the effect of nations meeting the highest level MPOWER measures between 2007 and 2014,Research Article,"Objective Since WHO released the package of six MPOWER measures to assist nations with implementing the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC), 88 countries adopted at least one highest level MPOWER measure. We estimated the subsequent reduction in smoking-related deaths from all new highest level measures adopted between 2007 and 2014. Methods Policy effect sizes based on previously validated SimSmoke models were applied to the number of smokers in each nation to determine the reduction in the number of smokers from policy adoption. On the basis of research that half of all smokers die from smoking, we derived the smoking-attributable deaths (SADs) averted of those smokers alive today. Findings In total, 88 countries adopted at least one highest level MPOWER policy between 2007 and 2014, resulting in almost 22 million fewer projected SADs. The largest number of future SADs averted was due to increased cigarette taxes (7.0 million), followed by comprehensive smoke-free laws (5.4 million), large graphic health warnings (4.1 million), comprehensive marketing bans (3.8 million) and comprehensive cessation interventions (1.5 million). Conclusions These findings demonstrate the immense public health impact of tobacco control policies adopted globally since the WHO-FCTC and highlight the importance of more countries adopting highest level MPOWER measures to reduce the global burden of tobacco use. Substantial additional progress could be made, especially if heavily populated nations with high smoking prevalence were to reach highest level MPOWER measures. ","A previous paper estimated that implementing highest level MPOWER policies between 2007 and 2010 averted about seven million premature deaths.

901,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Trends in Electronic Cigarette Use Among U.S. Adults: Use is Increasing in Both Smokers and Nonsmokers,article,"Objectives: We assessed trends in use of electronic cigarettes among U.S. adults, demographic predictors of use, and smoking status of current electronic cigarette users. Methods: Mixed-mode surveys were used to obtain representative, cross-sectional samples of U.S. adults in each of 4 years. Results: Sample sizes for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 were 3,240, 3,097, 3,101, and 3,245, respectively. Ever use of electronic cigarettes increased from 1.8% (2010) to 13.0% (2013), while current use increased from 0.3% to 6.8%, p < .001. Prevalence of use increased significantly across all demographic groups. In 2013, current use among young adults 18–24 (14.2%) was higher than adults 25–44 (8.6%), 45–64 (5.5%), and 65+ (1.2%). Daily smokers (30.3%) and nondaily smokers (34.1%) were the most likely to currently use e-cigarettes, compared to former smokers (5.4%) and never-smokers (1.4%), p < .001. However, 32.5% of current electronic cigarette users are never- or former smokers. Conclusions: There has been rapid growth in ever and current electronic cigarette use over the past 4 years. Use is highest among young adults and current cigarette smokers. Although smokers are most likely to use these products, almost a third of current users are nonsmokers, suggesting that e-cigarettes contribute to primary nicotine addiction and to renormalization of tobacco use. Regulatory action is needed at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure that these products do not contribute to preventable chronic disease.

491,Tobacco Control,2018,Do electronic cigarettes increase cigarette smoking in UK adolescents? Evidence from a 12-month prospective study,Other,"Background In cross-sectional surveys, increasing numbers of adolescents report using both electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and cigarettes. This study assessed whether adolescent e-cigarette use was associated prospectively with initiation or escalation of cigarette use. Methods Data were from 2836 adolescents (aged 13–14 years at baseline) in 20 schools in England. At baseline, breath carbon monoxide levels, self-reported e-cigarette and cigarette use, sex, age, friends and family smoking, beliefs about cigarette use and percentage receiving free school meals (measure of socioeconomic status) were assessed. At 12-month follow-up, self-reported cigarette use was assessed and validated by breath carbon monoxide levels. Results At baseline, 34.2% of adolescents reported ever using e-cigarettes (16.0% used only e-cigarettes). Baseline ever use of e-cigarettes was strongly associated with subsequent initiation (n=1726; OR 5.38, 95% CI 4.02 to 7.22; controlling for covariates, OR 4.06, 95% CI 2.94 to 5.60) and escalation (n=318; OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.21; controlling for covariates, this effect became non-significant, OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.82) of cigarette use. Conclusions This is the first study to report prospective relationships between ever use of e-cigarettes and initiation and escalation of cigarette use among UK adolescents. Ever use of e-cigarettes was robustly associated with initiation but more modestly related to escalation of cigarette use. Further research with longer follow-up in a broader age range of adolescents is required. ","Previous research: In cross-sectional surveys of UK adolescents, electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is increasing, cigarette use is decreasing and increasing numbers of adolescents report using both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Several studies among US adolescents suggest that self-reported e-cigarette use is associated with subsequent initiation of cigarette use, whereas one study in US adolescents found no association between e-cigarette use and escalation of cigarette use. However, these studies were all conducted in the USA, did not validate their self-reported smoking measures against objective measures and assessed only a limited range of risk factors for smoking as covariates and moderators of these relationships. Interpretation: Associations similar to those found in the previous studies are reported in a sample of UK adolescents and are validated against breath CO measures. Data collected over a 12-month period confirmed a sizeable relationship between ever use of e-cigarettes and subsequent initiation of cigarette use and showed that e-cigarette use is modestly associated with subsequent escalation of cigarette use. The former but not the latter relationship remained after controlling for various other risk factors for smoking (eg, intentions to smoke), only some of which had been assessed in previous studies. These findings support the robustness of the relationship between ever use of e-cigarettes and initiation of cigarette use but suggest the relationship between ever use of e-cigarettes and escalation of cigarette use may be explainable by other factors. Ever use of e-cigarettes was a stronger predictor of initiation of cigarette use in those with no friends who smoked at baseline compared with those with a few or most friends who smoked at baseline. The latter finding would not appear to be consistent with the suggestion that e-cigarette use may simply be a marker for those who would go on to smoke cigarettes even without having tried e-cigarettes.

455,Tobacco Control,2018,Telephone care co-ordination for tobacco cessation: randomised trials testing proactive versus reactive models,Other,"Objectives We conducted two parallel studies evaluating the effectiveness of proactive and reactive engagement approaches to telephone treatment for smoking cessation. Methods Patients who smoked and were interested in quitting were referred to this study and were eligible if they were current smokers and had an address and a telephone number. The data were collected at 35 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sites, part of four VA medical centres in both California and Nevada. In study 1, participants received multisession counselling from the California Smokers’ Helpline (quitline). In study 2, they received self-help materials only. Patients were randomly assigned by week to either proactive or reactive engagement, and primary care staff were blind to this assignment. Providers gave brief advice and referred them via the electronic health record to a tobacco co-ordinator. All patients were offered cessation medications. Outcome Using complete case analysis, in study 1 (quitline), patients in the proactive condition were more likely than those in the reactive condition to report abstinence at 6 months (21.0% vs 16.4%, p=0.03). No difference was found between conditions in study 2 (self-help) (16.9% vs 16.5%, p=0.88). Proactive outreach resulted in increased use of cessation medications in both the quitline (70.1% vs 57.6%, p<0.0001) and the self-help studies (74.5% vs 48.2%, p<0.0001). Conclusion Proactive outreach with quitline intervention was associated with greater long-term abstinence. Both studies resulted in high rates of medication use.

Methods The SRNT Treatment Research Network convened a group of investigators with expertise in tobacco biomarkers to update the recommendations of the 2002 SNRT Biochemical Verification Report. Results Biochemical verification of tobacco use and abstinence increases scientific rigor and is recommended in clinical trials of smoking cessation, when feasible. Sources, appropriate biospecimens, cutpoints, time of detection windows and analytic methods for carbon monoxide, cotinine (including over the counter tests), total nicotine equivalents, minor tobacco alkaloids, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol are reviewed, as well as biochemical approaches to distinguishing cigarette smoking from use of electronic nicotine delivery devices (ENDS). Conclusions Recommendations are provided for whether and how to use biochemical verification of tobacco use and abstinence. Guidelines are provided on which biomarkers to use, which biospecimens to use, optimal cutpoints, time windows to detection, and methodology for biochemical verifications. Use of combinations of biomarkers is recommended for assessment of ENDS use. Implications Biochemical verification increases scientific rigor, but there are drawbacks that need to be assessed to determine whether the benefits of biochemical verification outweigh the costs, including the cost of the assays, the feasibility of sample collection, the ability to draw clear conclusions based on the duration of abstinence, and the variability of the assay within the study population.

1587,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Association of Anhedonia With Adolescent Smoking Susceptibility and Initiation,article,"Introduction: Emerging literature implicates anhedonia—diminished capacity to experience pleasure—as a maintaining factor underlying cigarette smoking in adults. The role of anhedonia in adolescent smoking uptake has largely been uninvestigated, leaving unclear whether anhedonia is associated with smoking initiation and with psychosocial determinants of susceptibility to smoking initiation that could be targeted in prevention. This study examined the association of anhedonia with smoking initiation (ever smoke: yes/no) and factors indicative of susceptibility to smoking initiation among never-smokers (smoking outcome expectancies, curiosity about smoking, and willingness and future intention to initiate smoking). Methods: Ninth grade students enrolled in high schools in Los Angeles, CA (N = 3299; mean [SD] age = 14.1 [0.42] years) were administered in-classroom surveys of anhedonia, depression, smoking, and other characteristics. Results: For every 1 SD unit increase in anhedonia, there was (1) a 42% increase in odds of smoking initiation in the overall sample (odds ratio [95% CI] = 1.42 [1.30–1.56], p < .0001) and (2) higher scores on each marker of smoking initiation susceptibility in the subsample never-smokers (βs = .10–.19; ps ≤ .002). The associations remained after adjusting for demographics and major depression symptoms. Conclusions: By early adolescence: (1) anhedonia is associated with smoking initiation and (2) adolescents with higher (vs. lower) anhedonia who have never tried smoking may be more susceptible to smoking initiation perhaps due to stronger prosmoking intentions or willingness to smoke. Preventive interventions that target anhedonia and smoking-related intentions warrant consideration in interventions aimed at reducing risk of smoking initiation in affectively vulnerable youth. Implications: These data suggest that anhedonia may be useful to incorporate into theoretical models of the emotional determinants of smoking initiation risk and provide impetus for addressing anhedonia in smoking prevention efforts.

2522,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Thirdhand Smoke Contamination and Infant Nicotine Exposure in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: An Observational Study,article,"Introduction Thirdhand smoke (THS) is ultrafine particulate matter and residue resulting from tobacco combustion, with implications for health-related harm (eg, impaired wound healing), particularly among hospitalized infants. Project aims were to characterize nicotine (THS proxy) transported on neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) visitors and deposited on bedside furniture, as well as infant exposure. Methods Cross-sectional data were collected from participants in a metropolitan NICU. Participants completed a survey and carbon monoxide breath sample, and 41.9% (n = 88) of participants (n = 210) were randomly selected for finger-nicotine wipes during a study phase when all bedside visitors were screened for nicotine use and finger-nicotine levels. During an overlapping study phase, 80 mother–infant dyads consented to bedside furniture-nicotine wipes and an infant urine sample (for cotinine analyses). Results Most nonstaff visitors’ fingers had nicotine above the limit of quantification (>LOQ; 61.9%). Almost all bedside furniture surfaces (93.8%) and infant cotinine measures (93.6%) had values >LOQ, regardless of household nicotine use. Participants who reported using (or lived with others who used) nicotine had greater furniture-nicotine contamination (Mdn = 0.6 [interquartile range, IQR = 0.2–1.6] µg/m2) and higher infant cotinine (Mdn = 0.09 [IQR = 0.04–0.25] ng/mL) compared to participants who reported no household-member nicotine use (Mdn = 0.5 [IQR = 0.2–0.7] µg/m2; Mdn = 0.04 [IQR = 0.03–0.07] ng/mL, respectively). Bayesian univariate regressions supported hypotheses that increased nicotine use/exposure correlated with greater nicotine contamination (on fingers/furniture) and infant THS exposure. Conclusions Potential furniture-contamination pathways and infant-exposure routes (eg, dermal) during NICU hospitalization were identified, despite hospital prohibitions on tobacco/nicotine use. This work highlights the surreptitious spread of nicotine and potential THS-related health risks to vulnerable infants during critical stages of development. Implications THS contamination is underexplored in medical settings. Infants who were cared for in the NICU are vulnerable to health risks from THS exposure. This study demonstrated that 62% of nonstaff NICU visitors transport nicotine on their fingers to the NICU. Over 90% of NICU (bedside) furniture was contaminated with nicotine, regardless of visitors’ reported household-member nicotine use or nonuse. Over 90% of infants had detectable levels of urinary cotinine during NICU hospitalizations. Results justify further research to better protect infants from unintended THS exposure while hospitalized.

1961,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Implementing an Evidence-based Tobacco Control Program at Five 2-1-1 Call Centers: An Evaluation Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research,article,"Introduction The Smoke-Free Homes (SFH) Program is an evidence-based intervention offered within 2-1-1 information and referral call centers to promote smoke-free homes in low-income populations. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to conduct a mixed-methods analysis of facilitators and barriers to scaling up SFH to five 2-1-1 sites in the United States. Methods Data were collected from staff in 2015–2016 via online surveys administered before (N = 120) and after SFH training (N = 101) and after SFH implementation (N = 79). Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in 2016 with 25 staff to examine attitudes towards SFH, ways local context affected implementation, and unintended benefits and consequences of implementing SFH. Results Post-implementation, 79% of respondents reported that SFH was consistent with their 2-1-1’s mission, 70% thought it led to more smoke-free homes in their population, 62% thought it was easy to adapt, and 56% thought participants were satisfied. Composite measures of perceived appropriateness of SFH for 2-1-1 callers and staff positivity toward SFH were significantly lower post-implementation than pre-implementation. In interviews, staff said SFH fit with their 2-1-1’s mission but expressed concerns about intervention sustainability, time and resources needed for delivery, and how SFH fit into their workflow. Conclusions Sites’ SFH implementation experiences were affected both by demands of intervention delivery and by SFH’s perceived effectiveness and fit with organizational mission. Future implementation of SFH and other tobacco control programs should address identified barriers by securing ongoing funding, providing dedicated staff time, and ensuring programs fit with staff workflow. Implications Smoke-free home policies reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. Partnering with social service agencies offers a promising way to scale up evidence-based smoke-free home interventions among low-income populations. We found that the SFH intervention was acceptable and feasible among multiple 2-1-1 delivery sites. There were also significant challenges to implementation, including site workflow, desire to adapt the intervention, time needed for intervention delivery, and financial sustainability. Addressing such challenges will aid future efforts to scale up evidence-based tobacco control interventions to social service agencies such as 2-1-1.

2533,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,"Body esteem, weight-control outcome expectancies, and e-cigarette use among young adults",article,"Introduction Evidence is still scarce regarding the use of e-cigarettes by young people for weight-control reasons. This study aimed to test a model in which the prospective association between negative body esteem and e-cigarette use is mediated by weight-control outcome expectancies for e-cigarette use. The model was tested across genders. Methods Data were collected at three time points, 6 months apart, from 2327 young adults (mean age = 21.2; SD = 2.2; 54% women). Self-reported data were collected on demographics, body mass index, body esteem, weight-control outcome expectancies for e-cigarette use, and current e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking. Results Among women, we found a significant indirect effect of lower body esteem on higher likelihood of current e-cigarette use 1 year later, mediated by higher weight-control outcome expectancies at 6-month follow-up, adjusting for demographics, body mass index, and baseline e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking. Among men, body esteem was not found to have significant effect on either weight-control expectancies or e-cigarette use. Conclusions Based on the current findings, young adult women who have higher negative body esteem are at increased risk for using e-cigarettes for weight-control motives. Implications The current findings are some of the first to show prospective associations among weight-control motives and e-cigarette use among young adults. These findings suggest that a group of vulnerable young women may be using e-cigarettes to lose or control weight. More research is needed to understand their choice of flavors, nicotine concentration, and device type. In addition, research is needed to understand whether e-cigarettes are being marketed, directly or indirectly, as being useful for weight loss or control. There may be a need for health promotion strategies that provide healthier alternatives to young women struggling with low body esteem who use e-cigarettes for weight loss or control.

1662,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Descriptive Report of Electronic Cigarette Use After Participation in a Community-Based Tobacco Cessation Trial,article,"Introduction Smokers are using electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes, as a cessation aid, despite uncertainty about their efficacy. This report describes the association between use of e-cigarettes before and after cessation treatment and tobacco abstinence at 12 months. It also presents characteristics of e-cigarette users and reasons for use. Methods A longitudinal observational secondary analysis of self-reported e-cigarette use was conducted among adult Appalachian smokers enrolled in a community-based tobacco dependence treatment trial (n = 217). Data were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months following treatment. The primary outcome measure was biochemically-confirmed 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 12 months post-treatment. Results One in five participants reported using e-cigarettes post-treatment. Baseline sociodemographic and tobacco-related characteristics did not differ by e-cigarette use. Primary reasons for e-cigarette use included help in quitting, help in cutting down on cigarettes, and not as bad for health. At the 12 month follow-up, tobacco abstinence was significantly lower among post-treatment e-cigarette users (4.7%) than nonusers (19.0%); (OR = 0.21 95% CI: 0.05–0.91, p = .021). Baseline use was not associated with 12-month abstinence. Conclusions Among adult Appalachian smokers enrolled in community-based tobacco cessation treatment, use of e-cigarettes post-treatment was associated with lower abstinence rates at 12 months. Implications This descriptive report of electronic cigarette use after participation in a community-based group randomized tobacco dependence treatment trial adds to the body of science examining e-cigarette use and cessation. Post-treatment e-cigarette use was associated with less success in achieving abstinence at 12 months, as compared to nonuse. At 3 months post-treatment, the majority of those who reported use of e-cigarettes did so to assist with cessation.

549,Tobacco Control,2018,"Adolescent tobacco coupon receipt, vulnerability characteristics and subsequent tobacco use: analysis of PATH Study, Waves 1 and 2",Other,"Objectives We examine adolescent receipt of tobacco coupons and subsequent tobacco use. Methods Data were from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study (2013–2015). We identified correlates of coupon receipt at Wave 1 (youth sample age 12–17 ; n = 13 651) including demographics, additional vulnerability factors that may place youth at risk of tobacco use and correlates of coupon receipt by channel. We examined associations of Wave 1 coupon receipt with Wave 2 tobacco use using weighted multivariable models. Results Overall, 7.6% of US youth received tobacco coupons in the 6 months before Wave 1. Coupon recipients were more likely to be women, living outside urban areas, living with a tobacco user, current and former (vs never) tobacco users, having high internalising mental health symptoms and having a favourite tobacco advertisement. Coupons were received primarily through direct mail (56%), product packs (28%) and online (25%). Never tobacco users at Wave 1 who received coupons were more likely to be ever users at Wave 2 (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.42; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.91). Coupon recipients were more likely to use a new tobacco product between waves (aOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.18 to 2.36) and report past 30-day tobacco use at Wave 2 (aOR=1.81; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.49). Conclusions One in 13 US youth (7.6%) received coupons. Vulnerable youth had the greatest odds of coupon receipt. Coupon recipients had greater odds of tobacco use among never users, trying a new tobacco product and current use. Coupon bans, limits on youth coupon exposure, stronger age verification, pack inserts or restricting coupon redemption may help reduce tobacco use among adolescents, particularly for those at greatest risk. ","Exposure to tobacco marketing among youth is associated with initiation of tobacco use and increased consumption of tobacco products, and coupons are one of the most prevalent forms of direct tobacco marketing. Only one study has examined the prospective relationship between coupon receipt and later tobacco use, so the current study is the first US longitudinal study to fill this research gap. Vulnerable populations of youth including women, non-urban youth, those with high mental health symptoms, current and former tobacco users, those living with a tobacco users and youth with a favourite tobacco ad were more likely to receive coupons. Coupon receipt in this study was associated with greater likelihood of subsequent tobacco use among youth never users, greater odds of trying a new tobacco product and current use among all youth; however, there was no association between coupon receipt and continued use of tobacco in the past 30 days at both Wave 1 and Wave 2, or with past 30-day use among Wave 1 never users. These findings suggest that coupon receipt may be a catalyst of current tobacco use, trial of tobacco products among never users and use of a new tobacco product among all youth, but that a 1-year follow-up period may not be long enough to detect transitions to regular use among never users.

On 31 May 2012, Tianjin became one of the few cities in China to implement smoke-free legislation. We investigated the impact of smoke-free legislation on mortality due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke in Tianjin. Methods An interrupted time series design adjusting for underlying secular trends, seasonal patterns, population size changes and meteorological factors was conducted to analyse the impact of the smoke-free law on the weekly mortality due to AMI and stroke. The study period was from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2015, with a 3.5-year postlegislation follow-up. Results Following the implementation of the smoke-free law, there was a decline in the annual trends of AMI and stroke mortality. An incremental 16% (rate ratio (RR): 0.84; 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.85) decrease per year in AMI mortality and a 2% (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97 to 0.99) annual decrease in stroke mortality among the population aged ≥35 years in Tianjin was observed. Immediate postlegislation reductions in mortality were not statistically significant. An estimated 10 000 (22%) AMI deaths were prevented within 3.5 years of the implementation of the law. Conclusion The smoke-free law in Tianjin was associated with reductions in AMI mortality. This study reinforces the need for large-scale, effective and comprehensive smoke-free laws at the national level in China. ","This is the first study to measure the specific health impact of the smoke-free laws passed in major cities of mainland China excluding Hong Kong and Macau.

688,Tobacco Control,2019,Waterpipe tobacco package warning exposure’s impact on risk perceptions and use among young adults in the USA: a longitudinal analysis of the population assessment of tobacco and health study,Research Article,"Background Although Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-mandated waterpipe tobacco warnings were not required until August 2018, some waterpipe tobacco packaging (WTP) sold in the USA, contained warnings prior to this date. We examined the prevalence of WTP warning exposure and whether exposure influenced risk perceptions or use among young adult (aged 18–24 years) current waterpipe users. Methods We used data from waves 1 (2013–2014) and 2 (2014–2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of US adults and youth. We conducted logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with wave 1 warning exposure, and whether wave 1 WTP warning exposure predicted wave 2 relative risk perceptions and waterpipe use. Results More than one-third of our sample (35.9%, 95% CI 33.5 to 38.4) reported past-month WTP warning exposure. Exposure was higher among males (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.34, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.72), those who usually do not share the waterpipe (AOR=3.10, 95% CI 1.45 to 6.60), those who purchased waterpipe tobacco (AOR=1.73, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.34), and those with a regular brand (AOR=1.84, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.68). Those exposed to WTP warnings at wave 1 were more likely than those not exposed to perceive waterpipe tobacco to be as or more harmful than cigarettes at wave 2 (AOR=1.35, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.78). There was no association between wave 1 WTP exposure and wave 2 waterpipe use. Conclusions More than one-third of US young adult current waterpipe users reported WTP warning exposure prior to FDA-mandated warning implementation. Findings suggest the mandated warning may result in high exposure among users; it will be critical to assess exposure’s impact on risk perceptions and behaviour after FDA-mandated warnings are implemented. ","Warnings on tobacco packaging can be an effective way to communicate tobacco product risk to consumers. Exposure to warnings can increase knowledge, quit attempts and reduce use. It is unclear whether or how frequently waterpipe users are exposed to warnings. It is also unclear whether waterpipe tobacco package warning exposure influences harm perceptions and product use over time. Approximately one-third of US young adult waterpipe users reported past-month waterpipe tobacco package warning exposure in 2013–2014.

1430,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Smoking and Mental Illness: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Output Over Time,article,"Introduction: The prevalence of smoking among persons with a mental illness has remained unchanged, being 2–3 times higher than the general population in high-income countries. Assessment of the volume and characteristics of research output over time can assist in identifying research priorities to promote progress within a field. The aim of this study was to undertake such an assessment in the field of smoking and mental illness. Methods: A descriptive repeat cross-sectional study was conducted of peer-reviewed publications in Medline and PsycINFO for the periods 1993–1995, 2003–2005, and 2013–2015. Publications were classified as data- or non-data-based; data-based publications were further categorized by study type, population, setting, and for intervention-focused publications by level of evidence and research translation phase. Results: Included were 547 articles published in 1993–1995 (n = 65), 2003–2005 (n = 153), and 2013–2015 (n = 329). The number and proportion of data-based publications significantly increased over time, although their focus remained predominantly descriptive (≥83%); less than 14% of publications in any period had an intervention focus. The proportion of publications reporting on study populations with multiple diagnostic categories and recruiting from nonmental health settings, significantly increased from 1993–1995 to 2003–2005, however then plateaued by 2013–2015. The level of evidence provided by intervention-focused publications was suggested to increase over time, however there was no evident variation in translation phase. Conclusions: Research has increased over time to characterize smoking among those with a mental illness; however more is needed to inform the development and implementation of effective cessation interventions for this group. Implications: This is the first study to examine the volume and characteristics of research publications in the field of smoking and mental illness over time. The number of publications increased fivefold between 1993–1995 and 2013–2015. Between 1993–1995 and 2003–2005, progression was also indicated by increased: data-based publications, diagnostic diversity of samples, and variation in study settings; however further increases in such measures were not evident in 2013–2015. Notably, it continues to be the case that few intervention studies are undertaken.

151,Tobacco Control,2015,Cigarette price and other factors associated with brand choice and brand loyalty in Zambia: findings from the ITC Zambia Survey,Research Article,"Objectives Little is known about cigarette pricing and brand loyalty in sub-Saharan Africa. This study examines these issues in Zambia, analysing data from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Zambia Survey. Methods Data from Wave 1 of the ITC Zambia Survey (2012) were analysed for current smokers of factory-made (FM) cigarettes compared with those who smoked both FM and roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes, using multivariate logistic regression models to identify the predictors of brand loyalty and reasons for brand choice. Results 75% of FM-only smokers and 64% of FM+RYO smokers reported having a regular brand. Compared with FM-only smokers, FM+RYO smokers were, on average, older (28% vs 20% ≥40 years), low income (64% vs 43%) and had lower education (76% vs 44% < secondary). Mean price across FM brands was ZMW0.50 (US$0.08) per stick. Smokers were significantly less likely to be brand loyal (>1 year) if they were aged 15–17 years (vs 40–54 years) and if they had moderate (vs low) income. Brand choice was predicted mostly by friends, taste and brand popularity. Price was more likely to be a reason for brand loyalty among FM+RYO smokers, among ≥55-year-old smokers and among those who reported being more addicted to cigarettes. Conclusions These results in Zambia document the high levels of brand loyalty in a market where price variation is fairly small across cigarette brands. Future research is needed on longitudinal trends to evaluate the effect of tobacco control policies in Zambia. ","This paper reports findings from the first-ever national study of tobacco use in Zambia and its focus on price, brand choice and brand loyalty. It adds to the still-sparse literature on the economics of tobacco use in the African Region. Levels of brand loyalty are high in Zambia, despite low income. These findings will help inform public health practitioners on how to tailor their tobacco control interventions to appeal to different demographic groups. The findings on price distribution from this study demonstrate that very low prices, coupled with the very high prevalence (over 80%) of single cigarette purchases, pose a challenge for tobacco control efforts in the country and provide the foundation for initiatives to increase taxes on tobacco products.

750,Tobacco Control,2020,Impact of the NHS Stop Smoking Services on smoking prevalence in England: a simulation modelling evaluation,Research Article,"Background The English National Health Service NHS Stop Smoking Services (SSS), established in 2001, were the first such services in the world. An appropriate evaluation of the SSS has national and international significance. This modelling study sought to evaluate the impact of the SSS on changes in smoking prevalence in England. Methods A discrete time state-transition model was developed to simulate changes in smoking status among the adult population in England during 2001–2016. Input parameters were based on data from national statistics, population representative surveys and published literature. The main outcome was the percentage point reduction in smoking prevalence attributable to the SSS. Results Smoking prevalence was reduced by 10.8 % in absolute terms during 2001–2016 in England, and 15.3 % of the reduction could be attributable to the SSS. The percentage point reduction in smoking prevalence each year was on average 0.72%, and 0.11 % could be attributable to the SSS. The proportion of SSS supported quit attempts increased from 5.5 % in 2001, to as high as 18.9 % in 2011, and then reduced to 8.2 % in 2016. Quit attempts with SSS support had a higher success rate than those without SSS support (15.1% vs 11.3%). Smoking prevalence in England continued to decline after the SSS was much reduced from 2013 onwards. Conclusions Approximately 15% of the percentage point reduction in smoking prevalence during 2001–2016 in England may be attributable to the NHS SSS, although uncertainty remains regarding the actual impact of the formal smoking cessation services. ","The implementation of key tobacco control measures, including cigarette taxes, smoke-free laws, public information campaigns, advertising bans, health warning and cessation treatment, is associated with increased cessation rates and reduced smoking prevalence at the population level. The relative impact of each of the key tobacco control measures on a population’s smoking prevalence remains unclear. As the first such services in the world, the impact of the National Health Service Stop Smoking Services (SSS) on smoking prevalence in England has not been comprehensively quantified. Based on official statistical data and published literature, we developed a novel computational model to quantify the impact of the SSS on smoking prevalence between 2001 and 2016 in England.

1228,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Influence of the A118G Polymorphism of the OPRM1 Gene and Exon 3 VNTR Polymorphism of the DRD4 Gene on Cigarette Craving After Alcohol Administration,article,"Introduction:  The current study examined whether the presence of the G allele of the A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1 gene (rs1799971) and the long allele of exon 3 VNTR polymorphism of the DRD4 gene moderate the effect of alcohol administration on urge to smoke. These polymorphisms have been associated with greater alcohol induced-urge to drink. Urge to drink and alcohol consumption increase urge to smoke. Therefore, these polymorphisms may also sensitize urge to smoke after alcohol consumption.  Methods:  Individuals smoking 10–30 cigarettes per day and reporting heavy drinking were recruited from the community. Caucasians ( n = 62), 57.3% male, mean age 39.2, took part in a three-session, within-subjects, repeated-measures design study. Participants were administered a placebo, 0.4 g/kg, or 0.8 g/kg dose of alcohol. A118G genotype, exon 3 VNTR genotype, and urge to smoke (baseline and three times after receiving alcohol) were assessed.  Results:  G allele carriers showed greater urge to smoke across all assessments. Additionally, a significant interaction indicated that G carriers, compared to homozygotes (AA), evinced a significantly greater increase in urge to smoke after high dose alcohol relative to placebo. The interaction between condition, DRD4 polymorphism, and time was not significant.  Conclusions:  Presence of G allele of the A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1 gene may lead to greater increases in urge to smoke after a high dose of alcohol. Pharmacotherapies targeted to opiate receptors (eg, naltrexone) may be especially helpful in aiding smoking cessation among G carriers who are heavy drinkers.

1021,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Examination of the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68) Factor Structure in a Sample of Pregnant Smokers,article,"Introduction: Smoking during pregnancy poses known risks to fetal and infant development. Women who continue to smoke during pregnancy exhibit higher levels of nicotine dependence than women who quit. Increased understanding of the construct of nicotine dependence in pregnant smokers may aid in the development of effective treatments. Research has suggested that nicotine dependence is a multifaceted construct, driven not only by withdrawal and tolerance processes, but also by reinforcement, sensory, and contextual processes. The Wisconsin inventory of smoking dependence motives (WISDM-68) assesses 13 varied smoking motives in order to assess processes that may lead to nicotine dependence. Methods: The factor structure of the WISDM-68 was explored using an ethnically diverse sample of 294 pregnant women who had been screened and/or enrolled in a smoking cessation treatment study. Confirmatory analyses were conducted with previously published models. An exploratory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were conducted to develop and validate a measurement model for the WISDM-68 in this sample. Results: Previously established models were not a good fit for the present data. Using ESEM, a 9-factor model exhibiting both predictive and concurrent validity emerged. Two factors predicted abstinence 6 months posttreatment. Several factors were associated with smoking heaviness, the Fagerström test for cigarette dependence and time to first cigarette. Conclusions: In contrast to previously published studies, a 9-factor model best characterizes the WISDM in the present sample. These findings may reflect smoking motivations unique to young, pregnant women who continue to smoke during pregnancy.

978,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Population Support Before and After the Implementation of Smoke-Free Laws in the United States: Trends From 1992–2007,article,"Introduction: Several states implemented comprehensive smoke-free laws in workplaces (14 states), restaurants (17 states), and bars (13 states) between 2002 and 2007. We tested the hypothesis that public support for smoke-free laws increases at a higher rate in states that implemented smoke-free laws between 2002 and 2007 (group A) than in states that implemented smoke-free laws after that time or not at all (group B). The period before the implementation (1992–2001) was also considered. Methods: Data was used from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Tobacco Use Supplements (TUS), which is representative for the U.S. adult population. Respondents were asked whether they thought smoking should not be allowed in indoor work areas, restaurants, and bars and cocktail lounges. Differences in trends were analyzed with binomial mixed effects models. Results: Population support for smoke-free restaurants and bars was higher among group A than among group B before 2002. After 2002, support for smoke-free restaurants and bars increased at a higher rate among group A than among group B. Population support for smoke-free workplaces did not differ between group A and B, and the increase in support for smoke-free workplaces also did not differ between these groups. Conclusions: The positive association between the implementation of smoke-free restaurant and bar laws and the rate of increase in support for these laws partly supported the hypothesis. The implementation of the laws may have caused support to increase, but also states that have higher support may have been more likely to implement smoke-free laws.

1871,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,"National Comparison of Dual Users of Smokeless Tobacco and Cigarettes and Exclusive Cigarette Smokers, 2015–2016",article,"Introduction While smoking rates have declined, use of smokeless tobacco (ST) has remained constant. ST is heavily marketed to cigarette smokers, and many ST users smoke cigarettes. This study provides updated comparisons of the characteristics, smoking behaviors, and perceptions of US adult dual ST and cigarette users and exclusive cigarette smokers in 2015–2016. Methods Data were from nationally representative, cross-sectional surveys from 2015 and 2016. Adult smokers reported past 30-day use of ST, current cigarette smoking, risk perceptions, smoking, and quitting behaviors. We estimated Rao–Scott χ2 and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) to compare dual users and exclusive smokers. Results Dual users were more likely to be younger, reside in nonmetropolitan statistical areas (MSA) and outside the Northeast United States. Adjusting for covariates, dual users did not differ significantly from exclusive smokers on most smoker characteristics, including number of past year quit attempts. Dual users were more likely to report past 30-day use of novel tobacco products (AORs 2.90 [little cigars and cigarillos] to 11.02 [hookah]). Dual users who reported at least 1 past year cigarette quit attempt were more likely than exclusive smokers to report using ST, traditional cigars, hookah, or heat-not-burn as a past year quit method (AOR: 9.54 [95% CI: 3.22 to 28.23]). Conclusions Smokers who use ST are more likely than exclusive smokers to attempt to quit smoking cigarettes using other tobacco products. These findings may be attributed to increasing use prevalence of novel products. We recommend further monitoring to assess polytobacco use and differences among these populations. Implications Many current ST users smoke cigarettes and ST promotions often target cigarette smokers. As the FDA considers ST regulations and implements a nicotine centered regulatory framework, it is imperative to evaluate how these policies and promotion of ST as potentially reduced risk products impact dual and polytobacco use. Our study found that many dual users engage in novel tobacco use in general and as a cessation method. Consideration of ST and polytobacco use among smokers may be helpful in the development of forthcoming FDA regulations, messaging, and interventions.

1708,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Feasibility of Using Ecological Momentary Assessment to Study Unaided Smoking Cessation in Couples,article,"Introduction Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a valuable method for studying smoking cessation, but feasibility has not been examined in committed couples. The current study examines the feasibility of conducting an EMA study of unaided smoking cessation in single-smoker couples. Methods Participants were 62 single-smoker couples recruited to participate in a 21-day study of unaided smoking cessation. Quitters and Partners were given instructions to complete one morning report, three signaled reports, and one evening report per day, as well as lapse reports when necessary. They also completed a series of questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. This article examines predictors of compliance with the reporting instructions. Results Compliance with scheduled reporting was reasonable (Quitters: 76%, Partners: 79%). Compliance with “on-time” lapse reporting (vs. make-up reporting) was poor (Quitters: 62%, Partners: 43%). Quitters’ compliance with lapse reporting was strongly associated with an orientation toward quitting. Partners’ compliance with lapse reporting was associated with relationship motivation. Quitter compliance plummeted when Partners were noncompliant. Self-regulation and emotional instability were not associated with compliance but were associated with time to complete reports. Quitters’ and Partners’ experiences completing the study provide some insight into the dynamics of completing an EMA study as part of a dyad. Conclusions Overall, this study suggests it is feasible and effective to collect EMA data on smoking cessation from couples. However, compliance with lapse reporting was poor, especially for Partners. Researchers could provide remuneration on a different schedule, provide shorter lapse reports, or omit Partner lapse reports altogether. Implications This article examined compliance with scheduled and lapse reporting in single-smoker couples during an unaided quit attempt. Compliance with scheduled reporting was acceptable, but compliance with lapse reporting was poor, especially for Partners. Quitters’ compliance with lapse reporting was heavily influenced by an orientation toward quitting, suggesting that improved screening for motivation to quit might improve compliance rates. Quitter compliance also plummeted when Partners were noncompliant. Partner demographics and relationship motivation were the best predictors of compliance. To enhance compliance, researchers might provide remuneration on a different scale, dramatically shorten lapse reports, or even omit Partner lapse reports.

1325,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Slowing Menthol’s Progress: Differential Impact of a Tobacco Tax Increase on Cigarette Sales,article,"Objectives: The proportion of smokers who use menthol cigarettes has increased nationally since 2004, while use of non-menthol cigarettes is declining, suggesting that menthol may be undermining the effectiveness of population level tobacco control efforts. In 2013 Minnesota passed a $1.75 cigarette tax increase. We investigated whether sales of menthol and non-menthol cigarettes were differentially affected by the price increase. Methods: Cigarette sales data from convenience stores in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, metro area from January 2012, through May 2015, were obtained. Proportion of sales accounted for by menthol cigarettes was analyzed with segmented regression. Results: Before the price increase, menthol cigarettes gained 2.21% (1.17, 3.12) of market share annually. Following the price increase, the trend slowed to 0.26% (−0.78, 1.56) annually. The slope before the price increase was significantly positive; the slope following the price increase did not significantly differ from zero. Conclusions: Sales of menthol cigarettes declined less rapidly than non-menthol cigarettes before the price increase. Sales of menthol and non-menthol cigarettes declined at more comparable rates after the price increase. Increasing the price of tobacco may help ensure declines in consumption are more evenly distributed across menthol and non-menthol cigarettes. Implications: Using sales data, we found that a trend of increasing market share for menthol cigarettes was significantly reduced by a $1.75 cigarette price increase. These results suggest that cigarette price increases, a core tobacco control policy, may have a greater effect on menthol smokers than non-menthol smokers.

632,Tobacco Control,2019,Role of stakeholders in Nigeria’s tobacco control journey after the FCTC: lessons for tobacco control advocacy in low-income and middle-income countries,Other,"Introduction Nigeria ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2005. Tobacco control advocates in Nigeria achieved some success in countering tobacco industry interference to implement the FCTC. Methods We triangulated interviews with key informants from local and international organisations who worked in Nigeria with documentation of the legislative process and Nigerian newspaper articles. Data were analysed and interpreted using the Policy Dystopia Model and WHO categories of tobacco industry interference that had been developed mostly based on experience in high-income countries. Results As in high-income countries, the tobacco industry continued to oppose tobacco control policies after Nigeria ratified the FCTC, including weakening Nigeria’s 2015 National Tobacco Control Act. Both tobacco control advocates and industry used discursive (argument-based) and instrumental (activity-based) strategies. The industry argued self-regulation and the economic importance of tobacco. They exploited legislative procedures, used front groups and third parties to push for pro-industry changes. Advocates, with help from international organisations, mobilised prominent Nigerians and the public. Advocates pre-empted and countered the industry through traditional and social media, monitoring and exposing tobacco industry activities, and by actively engaging lawmakers and citizens during the legislative process. Conclusion The Policy Dystopia Model and WHO categories of industry interference provide a helpful framework for understanding tobacco control debates in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) as in high-income countries. One difference in LMIC is the important role of international tobacco control advocates in supporting national tobacco control advocates. This partnership is important in pushing for FCTC-compliant legislation and countering industry activities in LMIC. ",Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) ratification has not stopped the tobacco industry from using well-established tactics to stall tobacco control policy in Nigeria.

2087,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,"Smoking, Systemic Inflammation, and Airflow Limitation: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis of 98 085 Individuals From the General Population",article,"Introduction Smoking is associated with systemic and local inflammation in the lungs. Furthermore, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is often caused by smoking, there is often systemic inflammation that is linked to lung function impairment. However, the causal pathways linking smoking, systemic inflammation, and airflow limitation are still unknown. We tested whether higher tobacco consumption is associated with higher systemic inflammation, observationally and genetically and whether genetically higher systemic inflammation is associated with airflow limitation. Methods We included 98 085 individuals aged 20–100 years from the Copenhagen General Population Study; 36589 were former smokers and 16172 were current smokers. CHRNA3 rs1051730 genotype was used as a proxy for higher tobacco consumption and the IL6R rs2228145 genotype was used for higher systemic inflammation. Airflow limitation was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) <70%. Results Difference in plasma level of C-reactive protein was 4.8% (95% CI = 4.4% to 5.2%) per 10 pack-year increase and 1.6% (95% CI = 0.4% to 2.8%) per T allele. Corresponding differences were 1.2% (95% CI = 1.1% to 1.3%) and 0.5% (95% CI = 0.3% to 0.8%) for fibrinogen, 1.2% (95% CI = 1.2% to 1.3%) and 0.7% (95% CI = 0.5% to 1.0%) for α1-antitrypsin, 2.0% (95% CI = 1.8% to 2.1%) and 0.7% (95% CI = 0.4% to 1.1%) for leukocytes, 1.9% (95% CI = 1.8% to 2.1%) and 0.8% (95% CI = 0.4% to 1.2%) for neutrophils, and 0.8% (95% CI = 0.7% to 1.0%) and 0.4% (95% CI = 0.1% to 0.7%) for thrombocytes. The differences in these levels were lower for former smokers compared with current smokers. The IL6R rs2228145 genotype was associated with higher plasma acute-phase reactants but not with airflow limitation. Compared with the C/C genotype, the odds ratio for airflow limitation was 0.95 (95% CI = 0.89 to 1.02) for A/C genotype and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.87 to 1.01) for A/A genotype. Conclusions Higher tobacco consumption is associated with higher systemic inflammation both genetically and observationally, whereas systemic inflammation was not associated with airflow limitation genetically. Implications The association between higher tobacco consumption and higher systemic inflammation may be causal, and the association is stronger among current smokers compared to former smokers, indicating that smoking cessation may reduce the effects of smoking on systemic inflammation. Systemic inflammation does not seem to be a causal driver in development of airflow limitation. These findings can help to understand the pathogenic effects of smoking and the interplay between smoking, systemic inflammation, and airflow limitation and hence development and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

1448,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Effect of Pack Warning Labels on Quitting and Related Thoughts and Behaviors in a National Cohort of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Smokers,article,"Introduction The high prevalence of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia (39%) contributes substantially to health inequalities. This study assesses the impact of warning labels on quitting and related thoughts and behaviors for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers. Methods Participants were recruited from communities served by 34 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services and communities in the Torres Strait, Australia, using quota sampling. A cohort of 642 daily/weekly smokers completed relevant questions at baseline (April 2012–October 2013) and follow-up (August 2013–August 2014). Results We considered three baseline predictor variables: noticing warning labels, forgoing cigarettes due to warning labels (“forgoing”) and perceiving labels to be effective. Forgoing increased significantly between surveys only for those first surveyed prior to the introduction of plain packs (19% vs. 34%); however, there were no significant interactions between forgoing cigarettes and the introduction of new and enlarged graphic warning labels on plain packaging in any model. Forgoing cigarettes predicted attempting to quit (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–2.06) and, among those who did not want to quit at baseline, wanting to quit at follow-up (AOR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.06–9.63). Among those less worried about future health effects, all three variables predicted being very worried at follow-up. Often noticing warning labels predicted correct responses to questions about health effects that had featured on warning labels (AOR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.20–2.82) but not for those not featured. Conclusions Graphic warning labels appear to have a positive impact on the understanding, concerns and motivations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers and, through these, their quit attempts. Implications Graphic warning labels are likely to be effective for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers as they are for the broader Australian population.

2264,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Use of Mentholated Cigarettes and Likelihood of Smoking Cessation in the United States: A Meta-Analysis,article,"Introduction Previous qualitative reviews have summarized evidence of an association between menthol cigarette use and likelihood of smoking cessation. The objective of this meta-analysis was to provide a quantitative summary of effect sizes, their variability, and factors related to the variability in effect size for the association between menthol use and likelihood of smoking cessation. Methods We systematically searched Medline, PsycINFO, and Embase for prospective and cross-sectional studies of the association between menthol use and smoking cessation. We analyzed data with random effects meta-analyses and meta-regression. Results Our review identified 22 reports from 19 studies of the association between menthol use and cessation. All identified study samples included only US smokers, with one exception that included both Canadian and US smokers. Our overall model did not demonstrate a significant association between menthol use and cessation; however, menthol users were significantly less likely to quit among blacks/African American smokers (odds ratio = 0.88). Conclusions Among blacks/African Americans predominantly in the US menthol users have approximately 12% lower odds of smoking cessation compared to non-menthol users. This difference is likely the result of the tobacco industry’s ongoing marketing influence on the black/African American Community, suggesting that a menthol ban may have a unique public health benefit for black/African American smokers by encouraging quitting behavior. Implications This study adds a quantitative summary of the association between menthol cigarette use and smoking cessation in the United States. Findings of an association with lower likelihood of cessation among black/African American smokers, likely resulting from the tobacco industry’s marketing influence, support the ban of menthol flavoring as part of a comprehensive tobacco control effort to increase cessation among black/African American smokers.

1764,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Nicotine-Induced Neuroprotection against Cognitive Dysfunction after Partial Hepatectomy Involves Activation of BDNF/TrkB Signaling Pathway and Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling Pathway in Aged Rats,article,"Introduction The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of nicotine pre-treatment on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in aged rats. Methods Nicotine (0.5 mg/kg) was given i.p. immediately after anesthesia induction. After the Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the rats’ spatial learning and memory, serum and hippocampal tissues were harvested 1 and 3 days after intervention. Inflammatory cytokines in the serum were evaluated by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), p-TrkB, neuroinflammation cytokines, NF-κB p65, and cleaved caspase-3 were measured by western blotting; neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region was also evaluated by TUNEL staining. Results We found that nicotine markedly attenuated the POCD and reduced the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum, including IL-1β and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), on postoperative day 1. Additionally, nicotine suppressed the surgery-induced release of IL-1β, TNF-ɑ, HMGB1, and NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus on postoperative day 1 and day 3. In addition, operated rats displayed lower BDNF and p-TrkB in the hippocampus on postoperative day 1, returning to baseline by postoperative day 3. However, nicotine pre-treatment clearly reversed the surgical stress-induced decrease in both BDNF and p-TrkB expression in the hippocampus. Furthermore, nicotine pre-treatment significantly alleviated the surgery-induced increase in the neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus on postoperative day 1 and day 3. Conclusions Our results showed that nicotine-induced neuroprotection against POCD may involve activation of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Implications Nicotine has long been considered a potent therapeutic agent for neuroprotection. This study reported the positive effect of nicotine treatment on cognitive dysfunction after partial hepatectomy in aged rats. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism may involve activation of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the hippocampus.

2517,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Evidence for a Causal Relationship Between Academic Achievement and Cigarette Smoking,article,"Introduction Academic achievement (AA) is associated with smoking rates. Can we determine the degree to which this relationship is likely a causal one? Methods We predict smoking in male conscripts (mean age 18.2) assessed from 1984 to 1991 (N = 233 248) and pregnant females (mean age 27.7) receiving prenatal care 1972–1990 (N = 494 995) from AA assessed in all students at 16. Instrumental variable (IV) analyses used the instrument month-of-birth as in each school year, older children have high AA. Co-relative analyses used AA-smoking associations in the population, cousins and siblings to predict the AA-smoking relationship in MZ twins, thereby controlling for familial confounding. Results In males, higher AA was associated with a substantial decrease in risk for smoking (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence intervals [CIs]] per standard deviation [SD] = 0.41 [0.40–0.41]) while the parallel figures obtain from our IV and co-relative analyses were 0.47 (0.39–0.57) and 0.51 (0.43–0.60), respectively. In females, these figures for pre-pregnancy smoking were, respectively, 0.39 (0.39–0.39), 0.50 (0.46–0.54) and 0.54 (0.51–0.58). Results for heavy versus light smoking suggested a causal effect but were inconsistent across methods. However, among females smoking prior to pregnancy, AA predicted a reduced risk for continued smoking with ORs for uncontrolled, IV, and co-relative analyses equaling, respectively, were 0.54 (0.53–0.55) 0.68 (0.56–0.82) and 0.78 (0.66–0.91), respectively. Conclusions Two different methods produced consistent evidence that higher AA has a causal effect on reducing smoking rates and increasing cessation rates in smoking pregnant females. Improving AA may result in meaningful gains in population health through reduced smoking. Implications This study provides consistent evidence across two different methods that high AA is causally related to reduced rates of smoking and increasing rates of smoking cessation among pregnant women. Our results suggest that interventions that improve educational achievement in adolescence would reduce tobacco consumption, thereby improving public health.

1543,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Classification Tree Analysis as a Method for Uncovering Relations Between CHRNA5A3B4 and CHRNB3A6 in Predicting Smoking Progression in Adolescent Smokers,article,"Introduction: Prior research suggests the CHRNA5A3B4 and CHRNB3A6 gene clusters have independent effects on smoking progression in young smokers. Here classification tree analysis uncovers conditional relations between these genes. Methods: Conditional classification tree and random forest analyses were employed to predict daily smoking at 6-year follow-up in a longitudinal sample of young smokers (N = 480) who had smoked at least one puff at baseline and were of European ancestry. Potential predictors included gender, lifetime smoking, Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS), and five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging CHRNB3A6 and CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotypes A, B, and C. Conditional random forest analysis was used to calculate variable importance. Results: The classification tree identified NDSS, the CHRNB3A6 SNP rs2304297, and the CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C SNP rs6495308 as predictive of year 6 daily smoking with the baseline NDSS identified as the strongest predictor. The CHRNB3A6 protective effect was contingent on a lower level of baseline NDSS, whereas the CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C protective effect was seen at a higher level of baseline NDSS. A CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C protective effect also was observed in participants with low baseline NDSS who had no CHRNB3A6 rs2304297 minor allele. Conclusions: The protective effects of CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C and CHRNB3A6 on smoking progression are conditional on different levels of baseline cigarette use. Also, duplicate dominant epistasis between SNPs indicated the minor allele of either SNP afforded comparable protective effects in the absence of a minor allele at the other locus. Possible mechanisms underlying these conditional relations are discussed. Implications: The substantive contributions of this paper are the demonstration of a difference in the protective effects of CHRNB3A6 and CHRNA5A3B4 Haplotype C in young smokers attributable to level of cigarette use, as well as observation of duplicate dominant epistasis between the two markers. The methodological contribution is demonstrating that classification tree and random forest statistical methods can uncover conditional relations among genetic effects not detected with more common regression methods.

1627,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Evidence of Altered Brain Responses to Nicotine in an Animal Model of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,article,"Introduction Individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are susceptible to earlier and more severe nicotine addiction. To shed light on the relationship between nicotine and ADHD, we examined nicotine’s effects on functional brain networks in an animal model of ADHD. Methods Awake magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare functional connectivity in adolescent (post-natal day 44 ± 2) males of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) strain and two control strains, Wistar-Kyoto and Sprague-Dawley (n = 16 each). We analyzed functional connectivity immediately before and after nicotine exposure (0.4 mg/kg base) in naïve animals, using a region-of-interest approach focussing on 16 regions previously implicated in reward and addiction. Results Relative to the control groups, the SHR strain demonstrated increased functional connectivity between the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and retrosplenial cortex in response to nicotine, suggesting an aberrant response to nicotine. In contrast, increased VTA-substantia nigra connectivity in response to a saline injection in the SHR was absent following a nicotine injection, suggesting that nicotine normalized function in this circuit. Conclusions In the SHR, nicotine triggered an atypical response in one VTA circuit while normalizing activity in another. The VTA has been widely implicated in drug reward. Our data suggest that increased susceptibility to nicotine addiction in individuals with ADHD may involve altered responses to nicotine involving VTA circuits. Implications Nicotine addiction is more common among individuals with ADHD. We found that two circuits involving the VTA responded differently to nicotine in animals that model ADHD in comparison to two control strains. In one circuit, nicotine normalized activity that was abnormal in the ADHD animals, while in the other circuit nicotine caused an atypical brain response in the ADHD animals. The VTA has been implicated in drug reward. Our results would be consistent with an interpretation that nicotine may normalize abnormal brain activity in ADHD, and that nicotine may be more rewarding for individuals with ADHD.

2261,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Urine Metabolites for Estimating Daily Intake of Nicotine From Cigarette Smoking,article,"Introduction Accurate measurement of nicotine exposure from cigarette smoke is important in studying disease risk and level of dependence. Urine total nicotine equivalents, the molar sum of nicotine and six metabolites (NE7), accounts for more than 90% of a nicotine dose and is independent of individual metabolic differences. However, measuring NE7 is technically difficult and costly. We compared NE7, the gold standard of nicotine intake, with different combinations of fewer urinary nicotine metabolites. We also examined the impact of individual differences in nicotine metabolic rate, sex, and race on strength of association with NE7. Methods Urine samples from 796 daily smokers, who participated across five clinical studies, were assayed for nicotine and/or metabolites. Associations with NE7 were assessed by regression and Bland–Altman analyses. Results Overall, the molar sum of urine [cotinine + 3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC)] (NE2) and [nicotine + cotinine + 3HC] (NE3) were strongly correlated with NE7 (r = .97 and .99, respectively). However, in slow metabolizers NE2 was less predictive of NE7, whereas NE3 was equally robust. Urine total cotinine was also strongly correlated with NE7 (r = .87). Conclusions Urine NE3 is a robust biomarker of daily nicotine intake, independently of individual metabolic differences, whereas NE2 is less accurate in slow metabolizers. Our findings inform the selection of more rigorous and cost-effective measures to assess nicotine exposure in tobacco research studies. Implications The molar sum of urine total nicotine, cotinine and 3HC (NE3) is a robust biomarker of daily nicotine intake, independently of individual metabolic differences, and performs as well as measuring seven nicotine metabolites (NE7).

1628,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,HIV-1 Proteins Influence Novelty-Seeking Behavior and Alter Region-Specific Transcriptional Responses to Chronic Nicotine Treatment in HIV-1Tg Rats,article,"Introduction Clinical studies suggest that HIV-1-infected patients are more likely to use or abuse addictive drugs than is the general population. We hypothesized that HIV-1 proteins impact novelty-seeking behavior and enhance the transcriptional response to nicotine in genes implicated in both novelty-seeking behavior and drug addiction. Methods We assessed the effects of HIV-1 proteins on novelty-seeking behavior by comparing baseline activity differences of HIV-1Tg and F344 control rats in the open-field test. One day after behavioral testing, all rats began daily subcutaneous injections of either nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, base) or saline (the same for each rat) for 27 days. At the end of treatment, the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and ventral tegmental area were collected for RNA expression analysis of genes in the receptor families for dopamine, GABA, glutamate, and serotonin. Results Significant strain difference was detected in the distance moved in the center, such that HIV-1Tg rats traveled greater distance in the center of the arena than did F344 rats. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that mRNA from Drd3 and Grm2 in the prefrontal cortex and Drd5 and Gabra6 in the ventral tegmental area was significantly upregulated, whereas that of Drd5 in the nucleus accumbens was downregulated in HIV-1Tg rats compared with F344 rats. Further, more addiction-related genes were significantly modulated by nicotine in each brain region in the HIV-1Tg rats than in the control animals. Conclusions HIV-1 proteins may affect novelty-seeking behavior and modulate the expression of genes related to drug addiction and novelty-seeking behavior. Implications HIV-1 viral proteins and chronic nicotine treatment impact the expression of genes involved in novelty-seeking behavior and addiction in three brain regions of the HIV-1 transgenic rat. These findings implicate that HIV-1 proteins may be involved in novelty-seeking behavior and in modulating the expression of genes related to drug addiction and novelty seeking.

1838,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Content Analysis of US News Stories About E-Cigarettes in 2015,article,"Background Coverage of e-cigarettes in the news media may shape public perceptions about them but little is known about such news content. This content analysis characterized discussion of e-cigarettes in leading print and online US news sources in 2015. Methods We searched Access World News and Factiva databases for e-cigarette-related news articles appearing in the top 30 circulating newspapers, 4 newswires, and 4 online news sources in the United States in 2015 (n = 295). Coders identified the presence of various e-cigarette topics (e.g. regulation), and benefit and risk statements. Results Nearly half of articles (45.1%) focused primarily on e-cigarette policy/regulatory issues, although e-cigarette prevalence (21.0%) and health effects (21.7%) were common main topics. Concerns about youth were frequently mentioned, including the rise in youth e-cigarette use (45.4%), gateway to smoking potential (33.9%) and appeal of flavors (22.4%). Youth e-cigarette prevalence was more frequently mentioned than adult prevalence in articles discussing FDA regulation (61% vs. 13.5%, respectively). News articles more frequently discussed potential e-cigarette risks or concerns (80%) than benefits (45.4%), such as smoking harm-reduction. Quoted physicians, researchers, and government representatives were more likely to refer to e-cigarette risks than benefits. Conclusions In 2015, rising rates of e-cigarette use among youth and policy strategies to address e-cigarettes dominated US e-cigarette news stories, leading up to their FDA regulation in 2016. Statements about e-cigarettes’ potential risks were frequently attributed to trusted sources such as physicians, and outnumbered claims about their harm-reduction benefits. Such coverage may impact e-cigarette risk perceptions, use intentions and policy support. Implications In the year leading up to the FDA’s Deeming Rule, concerns about youth use or potential use were frequently discussed in e-cigarette news. News articles more frequently discussed potential e-cigarette risks/concerns compared to potential harm-reduction benefits relative to tobacco cigarettes. While such coverage may inform the public about potential e-cigarette risks, they may also contribute to increasing perceptions that e-cigarettes are as harmful as tobacco cigarettes. E-cigarette risk and benefit statements were most frequently made by or attributed to researchers and physicians in articles, which is significant given that they may be particularly trusted sources of e-cigarette risk information.

1518,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Reducing Disparities in Tobacco Retailer Density by Banning Tobacco Product Sales Near Schools,article,"Introduction: This study examined whether a policy of banning tobacco product retailers from operating within 1000 feet of schools could reduce existing socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco retailer density. Methods: We geocoded all tobacco retailers in Missouri (n = 4730) and New York (n = 17 672) and linked them with Census tract characteristics. We then tested the potential impact of a proximity policy that would ban retailers from selling tobacco products within 1000 feet of schools. Results: Our results confirmed socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco retailer density, with more retailers found in areas with lower income and greater proportions of African American residents. A high proportion of retailers located in these areas were in urban areas, which also have stores located in closer proximity to schools. If a ban on tobacco product sales within 1000 feet of schools were implemented in New York, the number of tobacco retailers per 1000 people would go from 1.28 to 0.36 in the lowest income quintile, and from 0.84 to 0.45 in the highest income quintile. In New York and Missouri, a ban on tobacco product sales near schools would either reduce or eliminate existing disparities in tobacco retailer density by income level and by proportion of African American. Conclusions: Proximity-based point of sale (POS) policies banning tobacco product sales near schools appear to be more effective in reducing retailer density in lower income and racially diverse neighborhoods than in higher income and white neighborhoods, and hold great promise for reducing tobacco-related disparities at the POS. Implications: Given the disparities-reducing potential of policies banning tobacco product sales near schools, jurisdictions with tobacco retailer licensing should consider adding this provision to their licensing requirements. Since relatively few jurisdictions currently ban tobacco sales near schools, future research should examine ways to increase and monitor the uptake of this policy, and assess whether it has an impact upon reducing exposure to tobacco marketing and on tobacco product availability and use.

2332,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Use of JUUL E-cigarettes Among Youth in the United States,article,"Introduction JUUL has emerged as the leading brand in a rapidly evolving electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) market. JUUL is distinctive for its novel nicotine delivery method that results in high nicotine concentrations, as well as its sleek, discreet design. This study examined national estimates of JUUL among youth in the United States, including whether JUUL users report different patterns of use compared to users of other e-cigarettes. Methods Data were analyzed from the US arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (ITC) Youth Tobacco and E-cigarette Survey, an online survey conducted in July–August 2017 with youth aged 16–19 years recruited from consumer panels (n = 4086). Results Overall, 14.2% of respondents had used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days. JUUL was the second-most popular brand reported by past-30-day e-cigarette users (9.7%). Compared to e-cigarette users of other brands, JUUL users were significantly older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.56 to 4.01) and reported a greater number of computers in the household (a socioeconomic status proxy; aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.22 to 1.96), with no differences by sex, race/ethnicity, or student status. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, JUUL users were more likely than other e-cigarette users to have ever tried to quit e-cigarettes (aOR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.12 to 6.30), with no differences observed by smoking status, frequency of e-cigarette use, urges to use e-cigarettes, or perceived addiction to e-cigarettes. Conclusions JUUL was among the most popular e-cigarette brands among youth, and there were few differences in sociodemographic profile or patterns of use between users of JUUL and other e-cigarette brands. Implications This study examined national estimates of JUUL e-cigarette use among youth in the United States, during the early phase of JUUL’s popularity. JUUL was among the most popular e-cigarette brands among youth, and there were few differences in sociodemographic profile or patterns of use between JUUL and other e-cigarette brands. The findings help to characterize the rapid rise of this new product category within the rapidly evolving e-cigarette market at a time when the US Food and Drug Administration and public health community are seeking to understand JUUL and its appeal among young people.

1647,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Perceptions of Snus Among US Adult Smokers Given Free Product,article,"Introduction Snus uptake is nominal among US smokers. This longitudinal study examines (1) perceptions of snus among US smokers given free snus for 6 weeks and (2) a method for assessment of an alternative tobacco product at the population level. Methods Adult smokers (n = 543; 69.2% female; Mage = 49.3 years), uninterested in quitting, received free snus for ad libitum use. Based on their snus use during a 6-week sampling period, participants included: (1) never users (18.4%, n = 100); (2) experimenters; that is, used ≥ once, but not during the last week of sampling (33.1%; n = 180); and (3) persistent users; that is, used ≥ once during the final week, and ≥ once during any other week of the sampling period. (48.4%; n = 263). Results Following the sampling period, those who became persistent users were more likely than experimenters to report that switching to alternative tobacco products would lower their risk for health problems (66.5% vs. 50.0%; p = .006). Persistent users also reported greater negative affect relief and craving reduction (ps < .001) than experimenters. Finally, persistent users were more likely than experimenters to describe snus in favorable terms with respect to ease of use, satisfaction, and liking (ps < .05). Conclusions Subjective experiences with snus, rather than nicotine dependence, explained experimentation versus persistent use. Even among smokers who became persistent snus users, snus was perceived as a poor substitute for cigarettes. This study design (randomized, yet naturalistic) could be extended to other novel tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, to help understand the role new products may have in the tobacco landscape. Implications This is the first large scale, US-based naturalistic assessment of smokers’ reactions to snus during an extended sampling period. This study is directly in line with FDA goals to better understand predictors of initiation, uptake, and use of other tobacco products such as snus, and serves as model for assessment methods of alternative tobacco products at the population level. Most smokers tried the provided sample of snus (approximately 82%). Subjective experiences with snus, rather than nicotine dependence, explained experimentation versus persistent use. Even among smokers who became persistent snus users, snus was perceived as a poor substitute for cigarettes.

1948,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Youth Access to Tobacco Products in the United States: Findings From Wave 1 (2013–2014) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study,article,"Objectives Tobacco products in the US market are growing in diversity. Little is known about how youth access tobacco products given this current landscape. Methods Data were drawn from 15- to 17-year-olds from the Wave 1 youth sample of the US nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Past 30-day tobacco users were asked about usual sources of access to 12 different tobacco products, and if they had been refused sale because of their age. Results Among 15- to 17-year-olds, social sources (“someone offered” or “asked someone”) were the predominant usual source of access for each tobacco product. “Bought by self” was the usual source of access for users of smokeless (excluding snus, 23.2%), cigarillos (21.0%), cigarettes (13.8%), hookah (12.0%), and electronic cigarettes (10.5%). Convenience stores and/or gas stations were the most often selected retail source for all products except hookah. Among youth who attempted purchase, 24.3% were refused sale of cigarettes, 23.9% cigarillos, and 13.8% smokeless tobacco. Conclusions Most 15- to 17-year-old tobacco users obtain tobacco products through social sources; however, among those who purchased tobacco, the majority report not being refused sale because of age. At the time of survey, cigarette and cigar sales to under 18 years were prohibited in all 50 states, and electronic cigarettes sales in 47 states and two territories. 2014 Annual Synar Reports signaled increasing trends in retail violations of state and/or district laws prohibiting tobacco product sales to under 18 years. Monitoring illicit youth sales, conducting compliance check inspections, and penalizing violations remain important to reduce youth tobacco access at retail venues. Implications Access to the spectrum of tobacco products by youth in the United States remains predominantly through social sources. However, of the minority of youth tobacco users in 2014 who purchased tobacco themselves, a few reported being refused sale: Convenience stores and/or gas stations were the most common retail source for tobacco products. The strategies of monitoring illicit youth sales, conducting compliance checks, and penalizing violations remain important to reduce youth tobacco access at retail venues. Limiting sources of youth tobacco access remains an important focus to reduce the burden of tobacco on the public health.

1734,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Proactive Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Smokers: The Role of Smoking-Related Stigma,article,"Introduction Smoking denormalization has been paralleled by reduced smoking prevalence, but smoking rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations remain high. The social unacceptability of smoking has also led to increased perceptions of smoking-related stigma. By examining how smoking stigma influences cessation intervention effectiveness, we can better tailor interventions to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. Aims and Methods Data are from a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a proactive cessation intervention on abstinence. Current smokers enrolled in Minnesota Health Care Programs were randomized to proactive outreach (n = 1200) or usual care (n = 1206). The intervention included mailings, telephone outreach, counseling, and access to free cessation treatments. Using baseline measurements, groups with lower (n = 1227) and higher (n = 1093) perceived stigma were formed. Intervention, stigma, and their interaction term were added to a logistic regression modeling abstinence at 12 months. Results Lower perceived smoking-related stigma was associated with less support for quitting, lower rates of physician quitting advice, and less motivation for quitting. A logistic regression modeling abstinence found a significant intervention × stigma interaction. The proactive intervention was more effective among smokers with lower perceived smoking-related stigma (odds ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval, 1.29 to 2.92) than those with higher perceived smoking-related stigma (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.55). Discussion Smokers with lower perceived smoking-related stigma had social environments that were conducive to smoking, received less physician advice to quit, and were less motivated to quit than higher stigma smokers. Despite these barriers, the intervention was more effective for lower stigma smokers, suggesting that proactive outreach is an efficient treatment for these hard-to-reach smokers. Implications Smoking denormalization has led to increased perceptions of smoking-related stigma among many smokers; however, little is known about how this stigma influences the cessation process. In the present study, smokers with lower levels of perceived smoking-related stigma lived in social environments that were more conducive to smoking and were less motivated to quit than higher stigma smokers. Despite these barriers, our proactive outreach cessation intervention was more effective for lower stigma smokers, suggesting that interventions which utilize proactive outreach to stimulate interest in quitting and offer facilitated access to free cessation treatments are an effective treatment approach for these hard-to-reach smokers. These strategies may be particularly effective for motivating smokers enrolled in government-subsidized health insurance programs to take advantage of cessation resources.

1657,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Daily Diary Study of Joint Quit Attempts by Dual-Smoker Couples: The Role of Received and Provided Social Support,article,"Introduction Smoking individuals often have a romantic partner who also smokes. Social support from a partner is assumed to be beneficial for successful smoking cessation. To date, no study has examined daily support and smoking in dual-smoker couples jointly attempting to quit. The aim was to test the hypothesis that smokers cut down more on days with higher received and provided emotional and instrumental support. Men are expected to benefit more from support provision of their female partners than vice versa. Aims and Methods In this dyadic diary study, 83 dual-smoker couples reported in daily mobile phone diaries number of cigarettes smoked, how much emotional and instrumental support they received from the other partner, and how much they provided to their partners for 22 consecutive days from a joint quit date on applying the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. Results Evidence was found for a support-smoking link for emotional and instrumental support. On days when women and men reported more received and provided support than usual, they smoked fewer cigarettes (actor effects for both). For men only, partner support was related to smoking: On days when women reported providing more support than usual, men smoked fewer cigarettes (partner effect for men). Conclusions Social support plays a key role for one’s own daily smoking in dual-smoker couples. Support provided by women but not by men was related to less smoking in partners. Findings emphasize the need for dyadic and daily assessments in longitudinal studies and trials to understand the dynamics of support in smoking cessation. Implications This study is the first to provide insights into the association between daily smoking and social support after a joint self-set quit attempt of dual-smoker couples using a dyadic intensive longitudinal approach. Received and provided emotional and instrumental support play a key role for one’s own daily smoking in dual-smoker couples after a joint self-set quit date. Furthermore, support provided by women was related to less smoking in partners. Because smokers with a romantic partner who also smokes have lower quit success, it is remarkable that this study replicates findings from a prior study with smoker–nonsmoker couples showing the central role of social support after a quit attempt.

2514,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Organizational Characteristics and Readiness for Tobacco-Free Workplace Program Implementation Moderates Changes in Clinician’s Delivery of Smoking Interventions within Behavioral Health Treatment Clinics,article,"Background Smoking is elevated amongst individuals with behavioral health disorders, but not commonly addressed. Taking Texas Tobacco Free is an evidence-based, tobacco-free workplace program that addresses this, in-part, by providing clinician training to treat tobacco use in local mental health authorities (LMHAs). This study examined organizational moderators of change in intervention delivery from pre- to post-program implementation.  Methods LMHA leaders completed the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) and provided organization demographics pre-implementation. Clinicians (N = 1237) were anonymously surveyed about their consistent use of the 5As (Asking about smoking; Advising clientele to quit; Assessing willingness to quit; Assisting them to quit; Arranging follow-up) pre- and post-program implementation. Adjusted generalized linear mixed models were used for analyses (responses nested within LMHAs), with interaction terms used to assess moderation effects.  Results Clinician delivery of 5As increased pre- to post-implementation (p < .001). LMHAs with fewer employees (ref = ≤300) demonstrated greater increases in Asking, Assessing, and Assisting over time. LMHAs with fewer patients (ref = ≤10 000) evinced greater changes in Asking over time. Less initial ORIC Change Efficacy, Change Commitment, and Task Knowledge were each associated with greater pre- to post-implementation changes in Asking. Less initial Task Knowledge was associated with greater increases in Advising, Assessing, and Assisting. Finally, less initial Resource Availability was associated with greater increases in Assisting (all moderation term ps < .025). Conclusion The smallest and least ready LMHAs showed the largest gains in tobacco cessation intervention delivery; thus, low initial readiness was not a barrier for program implementation, particularly when efficacy-building training and resources are provided. Implications This study examined organizational moderators of increases in tobacco cessation treatment delivery over time following the implementation of a comprehensive tobacco-free workplace program within 20 of 39 LMHAs across Texas (hundreds of clinics; servicing >50% of the state) from 2013 to 2018. Overall, LMHAs with fewer employees and patients, and that demonstrated the least initial readiness for change, evinced greater gains in intervention delivery. Findings add to dissemination and implementation science by supporting that low initial readiness was not a barrier for this aspect of tobacco-free workplace program implementation when resources and clinician training sessions were provided.

This study used nationally representative data to examine unaided quit attempts and their sociodemographic determinants among daily current and former smokers who made a quit attempt in the last 12 months. Methods:  We used data from the 2010–2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. We limited the analysis to current daily smokers who made a quit attempt in the past year and former smokers who were daily smokers 1 year prior to the survey ( N = 8201).  Results:  Nearly 62% ( n = 5078) of the sample made an unaided quit attempt. Adjusted results indicated unaided quit attempts were more likely among males compared to females ( P < .001), younger age groups compared to older age groups ( P < .001), non-Hispanic blacks compared to non-Hispanic whites ( P < .001), among people with lower income compared to people with higher income ( P < .001), and among people with lower nicotine dependence compared to those with higher nicotine dependence ( P < .001).  Conclusions: Most quit attempts were unaided and there were significant sociodemographic disparities in unaided quit attempts. Considering that cessation aids enhance the likelihood of quitting, policies and programs should target populations which are more likely to attempt quitting without an aid and encourage them to use or provide subsidized cessation aids. Healthcare providers should advise their patients about approaches to quitting. Implications: This study used the most recent nationally representative data for the United States to examine sociodemographic disparities in unaided quitting among current and former daily smokers who made a quit attempt in the last 12 months. Most quit attempts were unaided. People who were male, younger, non-Hispanic black, had lower nicotine dependence, and those who were low income were more likely to make an unaided quit attempt. These results could be used by policy makers and program planners to develop cessation interventions directed at specific populations to improve smoking cessation rates.

404,Tobacco Control,2017,Tobacco retail outlet restrictions: health and cost impacts from multistate life-table modelling in a national population,Research Article,"Background Since there is some evidence that the density and distribution of tobacco retail outlets may influence smoking behaviours, we aimed to estimate the impacts of 4 tobacco outlet reduction interventions in a country with a smoke-free goal: New Zealand (NZ). Methods A multistate life-table model of 16 tobacco-related diseases, using national data by sex, age and ethnicity, was used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and net costs over the remainder of the 2011 NZ population's lifetime. The outlet reduction interventions assumed that increased travel costs can be operationalised as equivalent to price increases in tobacco. Results All 4 modelled interventions led to reductions of >89% of current tobacco outlets after the 10-year phase-in process. The most effective intervention limited sales to half of liquor stores (and nowhere else) at 129 000 QALYs gained over the lifetime of the population (95% UI: 74 100 to 212 000, undiscounted). The per capita QALY gains were up to 5 times greater for Māori (indigenous population) compared to non-Māori. All interventions were cost-saving to the health system, with the largest saving for the liquor store only intervention: US$1.23 billion (95% UI: $0.70 to $2.00 billion, undiscounted). Conclusions These tobacco outlet reductions reduced smoking prevalence, achieved health gains and saved health system costs. Effects would be larger if outlet reductions have additional spill-over effects (eg, smoking denormalisation). While these interventions were not as effective as tobacco tax increases (using the same model), these and other strategies could be combined to maximise health gain and to maximise cost-savings to the health system. ","There is increasing policy and research interest in restrictions on tobacco retail outlet locations and density, including for achieving tobacco endgame goals. This study used an established tobacco control model, modelling reduced outlet availability in terms of increased travel costs, to study four outlet reduction interventions at a country level (New Zealand). It found that the most effective was one that limited tobacco sales to 50% of liquor outlets (and nowhere else). But other interventions, such as retail-free zones around schools, were also effective and also achieved net cost-savings to the health system. The interventions should reduce health inequalities with around five times the per capita health gain for Māori (indigenous) compared to non-Māori. These interventions were still not as effective as increases in tobacco tax (using the same model and assuming outlet reductions can be modelled as a cost increase to the smoker), but ultimately they could be combined with such strategies in comprehensive tobacco control programmes.

1722,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Nicotine and Carbonyl Emissions From Popular Electronic Cigarette Products: Correlation to Liquid Composition and Design Characteristics,article,"Introduction Available in hundreds of device designs and thousands of flavors, electronic cigarette (ECIG) may have differing toxicant emission characteristics. This study assesses nicotine and carbonyl yields in the most popular brands in the U.S. market. These products included disposable, prefilled cartridge, and tank-based ECIGs. Methods Twenty-seven ECIG products of 10 brands were procured and their power outputs were measured. The e-liquids were characterized for pH, nicotine concentration, propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG/VG) ratio, and water content. Aerosols were generated using a puffing machine and nicotine and carbonyls were, respectively, quantified using gas chromatograph and high-performance liquid chromatography. A multiregression model was used to interpret the data. Results Nicotine yields varied from 0.27 to 2.91 mg/15 puffs, a range corresponding to the nicotine yield of less than 1 to more than 3 combustible cigarettes. Nicotine yield was highly correlated with ECIG type and brand, liquid nicotine concentration, and PG/VG ratio, and to a lower significance with electrical power, but not with pH and water content. Carbonyls, including the carcinogen formaldehyde, were detected in all ECIG aerosols, with total carbonyl concentrations ranging from 3.72 to 48.85 µg/15 puffs. Unlike nicotine, carbonyl concentrations were mainly correlated with power. Conclusion In 15 puffs, some ECIG devices emit nicotine quantities that exceed those of tobacco cigarettes. Nicotine emissions vary widely across products but carbonyl emissions showed little variations. In spite of that ECIG users are exposed to toxicologically significant levels of carbonyl compounds, especially formaldehyde.

1482,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Smokeless Tobacco Use Among Adolescents in Global Perspective,article,"The smokeless tobacco (SLT) use among adolescents has severe implications on chronic disease burden in adults. SLT use among adolescents is diverse in composition, additives, methods of preparation and consumption and follows the adult pattern in individual countries. High rates of concurrent cigarette smoking in many countries of the world suggest a possible role of SLT products as a gateway to smoking among adolescents. Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) is a school based survey that collects data on students aged 13–15 years using a standard methodology for constructing the sample frames, selecting schools and classes and processing data. This methodology also provides flexibility to the countries to add additional country specific questions. GYTS has been mapping tobacco use prevalence among school going adolescents aged 13–15 years since 1999 in countries around the world. By 2008, studies based on GYTS results from 140 WHO member states and 11 other populations revealed that use of tobacco products other than cigarette was similar or higher among adolescents as compared to cigarette smoking and there was no difference in use of tobacco products other than cigarette between boys and girls in majority of sites. In studies based on GYTS data from 32 countries, adolescents in African and South-East Asia region were more likely to use SLT as compared to adolescent in United States.

2254,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Prolonging the Reduction of Nicotine Self-Administration in Rats by Coadministering Chronic Nicotine With Amitifadine, a Triple Monoamine Reuptake Inhibitor With CYP2B6 Inhibitory Actions",article,"Introduction Existing treatments can aid tobacco smoking cessation, but they have low efficacy. Because there is a network of neural systems involved in tobacco addiction, combination treatments may provide greater efficacy. Chronic nicotine and amitifadine have each been shown to significantly reduce nicotine self-administration in rats. This study was conducted to determine if the combination of chronic nicotine with amitifadine, a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor with CYP2B inhibitory effects, would reduce nicotine self-administration to a greater extent than either alone or placebo. Methods This study tested the combination of nicotine plus amitifadine in young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats self-administering nicotine (0.03 mg/kg/infusion). This combination was compared with each treatment alone and the vehicle during continuing nicotine self-administration as well as during resumption of self-administration after a week of enforced abstinence, modeling a quit attempt. Finally, we studied the residual effects of these therapies after discontinuation of treatment. Results Treatment with either chronic nicotine or amitifadine alone significantly reduced nicotine self-administration relative to controls. The combination of the treatments significantly enhanced this effect. After treatment withdrawal, all of the groups showed increases in nicotine self-administration, but only the combined treatment group remained significantly below control rates of nicotine self-administration. Conclusions This study showed the promise of amitifadine as a possible new treatment for smoking cessation and suggested that amitifadine is more effective when given with chronic nicotine. The improved efficacy of the amitifadine and nicotine combination may be potentiated by amitifadine’s inhibitory effects on CYP2B, which slows nicotine metabolism. Implications This study replicated the effects that chronic nicotine or chronic amitifadine, a triple reuptake inhibitor, significantly reduces nicotine self-administration in rats. It extends those findings by showing that the combination of chronic nicotine plus amitifadine causes significantly greater reduction in nicotine self-administration than either drug treatment alone. The combination of chronic amitifadine and chronic nicotine also causes a persistent significant reduction in nicotine self-administration after the end of treatment. The amitifadine and nicotine treatment should be assessed in humans to determine whether this combination provides greater efficacy in smoking cessation than transdermal nicotine treatment alone.

1084,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Change in Body Weight Does Not Mediate the Relationship Between Exercise and Smoking Cessation Among Weight-Concerned Women Smokers,article,"Introduction: Exercise has received attention as a method to prevent or reduce postcessation weight gain. However, little is known about how weight changes following quit attempts contribute to the relationship between exercise and smoking cessation. The present study assessed how exercise relates to cessation and whether initial changes in exercise after quitting smoking promote cessation through attenuated weight gain. Methods: Weight-concerned women smokers (N = 342) receiving cessation treatment provided biochemical validation of cessation, reported weekly exercise activities, and were weighed at 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment initiation. Survival analyses were used to determine time to and risk of relapse among women who reported engaging in varied levels of exercise at baseline. A mediation analysis was used to examine whether the effect of initial changes in exercise on longer-term cessation was driven by change in weight. All analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates. Results: Women smokers who reported high levels of exercise at baseline were less likely to relapse and returned to smoking more gradually than did women who reported low levels of exercise. Change in weight did not mediate the relationship between exercise and cessation. Conclusions: Cessation interventions utilizing an exercise component may have to develop exercise regimens of either higher duration or greater intensity to produce beneficial cessation outcomes, particularly when targeting sedentary smokers. Given that change in weight did not mediate the relationship between exercise and cessation, it is likely that other mediational processes are involved.

233,Tobacco Control,2016,The smoking population in the USA and EU is softening not hardening,Research Article,"Background It has been argued that as smoking prevalence declines in countries, the smokers that remain include higher proportions of those who are unwilling or unable to quit (a process known as ‘hardening’). Smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes have been promoted as a strategy to deal with such smokers. If hardening is occurring, there would be a positive association between smoking prevalence and quitting, with less quitting at lower prevalence. There would also be a neutral or negative association between prevalence and the number of cigarettes smoked. Methods We examined US state-level associations using the Tobacco Use Supplement (1992/1993–2010/2011) and Eurobarometer surveys for 31 European countries (2006–2009–2012) using regressions of quit attempts, quit ratios, and number of cigarettes smoked on smoking prevalence over time. Results For each 1% drop in smoking prevalence, quit attempts increase by 0.55%±.07 (p<0.001) in the USA and remain stable in Europe (p=0.53), US quit ratios increase by 1.13%±0.06 (p<0.001), and consumption drops by 0.32 cig/day±0.02 (p<0.001) in the USA and 0.22 cig/day±0.05 (p<0.001) in Europe. These associations remain stable over time (p>0.24), with significantly lower consumption at any given prevalence level as time passed in the USA (−0.15 (cig/day)/year±0.06, p<0.05). Conclusions Consistent with prior research using different data and methods, these population-level results reject the hypothesis of hardening as smoking prevalence drops, instead supporting softening of the smoking population as prevalence declines. ","It has been argued that as smoking prevalence declines in countries, the smokers that remain include higher proportions of hardcore smokers who are unwilling or unable to quit. This study shows that as smoking prevalence has declined, quit attempts and quit ratios increased in the USA, and quit attempts remained stable in the EU.

2084,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Smoking Following Release From Smoke-Free Prisons,article,"Introduction Given the current proliferation of prison smoke-free policies internationally, and the multiple benefits of continued smoking abstinence for correctional populations, improved understanding of factors influencing postrelease smoking abstinence is required to inform support strategies aimed at individuals exiting smoke-free prisons. Methods We systematically searched health, social science, and criminal justice databases for studies relating to smoking behaviors among people released from smoke-free prisons. Studies were included if: they were published between January 1, 2000 and July 26, 2017; they were published in English; the population was people who were incarcerated or formerly incarcerated in prisons with total smoke-free policies; and the reported outcomes included measures of: (1) prerelease intention to smoke or remain abstinent from smoking following release, (2) smoking relapse or abstinence following release, or (3) quit attempts following postrelease smoking relapse. Both authors independently screened returned citations to assess eligibility and reviewed studies for methodological quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project’s Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Results Fifteen of 121 publications were included. The evidence base in this area is small, almost exclusively US-based, and is mostly methodologically weak. Interventions delivered both pre and postrelease, that strengthen intention to quit, integrate with other substance-use treatment, and facilitate social support for quitting may help maintain postrelease smoking abstinence. Conclusions There is an urgent need for high-quality research to inform interventions to reduce high smoking relapse rates upon release from smoke-free prisons, to extend the multiple benefits of continued smoking abstinence into the community. Implications Interventions designed to help people remain abstinent from tobacco following release from smoke-free prisons are an important opportunity to improve the health, finances, and well-being of this vulnerable population.

1027,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Effects of Nicotine and Nicotine Expectancy on Attentional Bias for Emotional Stimuli,article,"Introduction: Nicotine’s effects on mood are thought to enhance its addictive potential. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of nicotine on affect regulation have not been reliably demonstrated in human laboratory studies. We investigated the effects of nicotine abstinence (Experiment 1), and nicotine challenge and expectancy (Experiment 2) on attentional bias towards facial emotional stimuli differing in emotional valence. Methods: In Experiment 1, 46 nicotine-deprived smokers were randomized to either continue to abstain from smoking or to smoke immediately before testing. In Experiment 2, 96 nicotine-deprived smokers were randomized to smoke a nicotinized or denicotinized cigarette and to be told that the cigarette did or did not contain nicotine. In both experiments participants completed a visual probe task, where positively valenced (happy) and negatively valenced (sad) facial expressions were presented, together with neutral facial expressions. Results: In Experiment 1, there was evidence of an interaction between probe location and abstinence on reaction time, indicating that abstinent smokers showed an attentional bias for neutral stimuli. In Experiment 2, there was evidence of an interaction between probe location, nicotine challenge and expectation on reaction time, indicating that smokers receiving nicotine, but told that they did not receive nicotine, showed an attentional bias for emotional stimuli. Conclusions: Our data suggest that nicotine abstinence appears to disrupt attentional bias towards emotional facial stimuli. These data provide support for nicotine’s modulation of attentional bias as a central mechanism for maintaining affect regulation in cigarette smoking.

1814,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,"Effects of 30% and 50% Cigarette Pack Graphic Warning Labels on Visual Attention, Negative Affect, Quit Intentions, and Smoking Susceptibility among Disadvantaged Populations in the United States",article,"Introduction Though the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) calls for the implementation of large graphic warning labels (GWLs) on cigarette boxes, the courts have blocked the implementation of 50% labels in the United States. We conducted an experiment to explore whether changing the size of GWLs is associated with changes in visual attention, negative affect, risk beliefs, and behavioral intentions. Method We recruited adult smokers (N = 238) and middle-school youth (N = 237) throughout the state of New York in May 2016. We randomly assigned participants to one of three between-subject conditions (no GWL [control], 30% GWL, 50% GWL). Results Adult and youth participants looked at the GWLs longer when the GWL covered 50% versus 30% of the pack’s front. Increasing GWL size from 30% to 50% did not influence negative affect or risk beliefs, though both GWL sizes increased negative affect relative to the no-GWL control group. Exposure to 50% GWLs increased adult smokers’ intentions to quit compared to no-GWL, but smokers exposed to 30% GWLs did not differ from control. There were no differences between 50% GWLs, 30% GWLs, and control on youth smoking susceptibility. Conclusions Findings provide some evidence of the benefits of a 50% versus 30% GWL covering the front of the pack for adult smokers and at-risk youth from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds—though not on all outcomes. Implications This research shows that 30% GWLs on cigarette packages increase negative affect relative to packages without front-of-package GWLs. Larger GWLs on cigarette packages (50% vs. 30%) increase visual attention to the warning and its pictorial content among low-SES smokers and at-risk youth but do not further increase negative affect. A 50% GWL increased adults’ quit intention compared to no GWL at all, but we were underpowered to detect modest differences in quit intentions between a 50% and 30% GWL. Future work should thus continue to explore the boundary conditions under which relatively larger GWLs influence cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes.

1019,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Cost-Effectiveness of Nicotine Patches for Smoking Cessation in Pregnancy: A Placebo Randomized Controlled Trial (SNAP),article,"Introduction: Smoking during pregnancy is the most important, preventable cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, premature birth, and low birth weight with huge financial costs to the National Health Service. However, there are very few published economic evaluations of smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy and previous studies are predominantly U.S.-based and do not present incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). A number of studies have demonstrated cost-effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the general population, but this has yet to be tested among pregnant smokers. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken alongside the smoking, nicotine, and pregnancy trial to compare NRT patches plus behavioral support to behavioral support alone, for pregnant women who smoked. Results: At delivery, biochemically verified quit rates were slightly higher at 9.4% in the NRT group compared to 7.6% in the control group (odds ratio = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.82–1.96), at an increased cost of around £90 per participant. Higher costs in the NRT group were mainly attributable to the cost of NRT patches (mean = £46.07). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with NRT was £4,926 per quitter and a sensitivity analysis including only singleton births yielded an ICER of £4,156 per quitter. However, wide confidence intervals indicated a high level of uncertainty. Conclusions: Without a specific willingness to pay threshold, and due to high levels of statistical uncertainty, it is hard to determine the cost-effectiveness of NRT in this population. Furthermore, future research should address compliance issues, as these may dilute any potential effects of NRT, thus reducing the cost-effectiveness.

1009,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Does Government Supervision Improve Stop-Smoking Counseling in Midwifery Practices?,article,"Introduction: Smoking-cessation counseling during pregnancy is important to prevent smoking-related harm in pregnant smokers and their children. Therefore we evaluated the effects of an Inspectorate’s supervision programme on the provision of smoking-cessation counseling by midwifery practices in the Netherlands. The supervision programme consisted of 3 elements: A) A deadline was announced by which all practices should comply with professional norms on such counseling (2011); B) A set of randomly selected practices were assessed using a questionnaire and a personal feedback report (2010); C) Another set of randomly selected practices were assessed through a site visit and a personal feedback report (2012). Methods: Programme A was evaluated in a before-after study, Programmes B and C were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with only a post-intervention measurement. Primary outcome was provision of smoking-cessation counseling through a minimal-intervention strategy (V-MIS). Linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze data from 233 primary-care midwifery practices. Results: A) After announcement of the deadline, Dutch midwifery practices reported significantly more provision of smoking-cessation counseling. For example, the use of V-MIS increased substantially from 28% to 80%; B) In practices that were assessed with a questionnaire, the provision of counseling improved partially compared to controls; C) The provision of counseling did not differ between practices that were visited and their controls. While the training participation rate in counseling by midwifery practices did not differ between the intervention and control groups, the rate increased significantly in all practices after the start of the supervision programme. Conclusions: The provision of smoking-cessation counseling improved spectacularly in Dutch midwifery practices. Despite some limitations of our study, the Inspectorate’s supervision programme is likely to have contributed to the improvements in provision of counseling.

746,Tobacco Control,2020,How has the introduction of point-of-sale legislation affected the presence and visibility of tobacco retailing in Scotland? A longitudinal study,Research Article,"Background Reducing the local availability of tobacco is identified as the ‘next frontier’ in tobacco control. This paper examines the roles of tobacco retail outlet density and tobacco visibility in changing exposure to tobacco retailing before and after the introduction of point-of-sale (POS) legislation in Scotland. Methods National tobacco retailer register data were analysed to examine time trends in tobacco retailer density (2012–2017). Results were stratified by local authority, neighbourhood deprivation and urbanity. Next, an annual retail audit using a POS tobacco visibility tool assessed changes in total product visibility in all retail outlets in four study communities between 2013 and 2017. A longitudinal survey (2013–2017) of 5527 adolescents aged 12–17 in the four study communities enabled the calculation of residential and journey-to-school measures of tobacco retailer exposure. Trends were stratified by deprivation, urbanity and socioeconomic status. Results Retail provision of tobacco declined following the introduction of the POS legislation in 2013. However, there were strong geographic differences; nationally, one-fifth of local authorities have increased provision since 2015. In the four study communities, tobacco retail provision was generally stable over the study period. Although product visibility of tobacco products reduced for adolescents there was growing socioeconomic disparity in the density of tobacco retailers and the visibility of tobacco storage. Conclusions The POS ban reduced exposure to tobacco products in communities across Scotland. However, tobacco products remain widely available, and there is growing socioeconomic disparity in the availability and visibility of tobacco. ","Higher local availability of tobacco products tends to be associated with smoking initiation, greater smoking prevalence and lower levels of cessation. Tobacco retailers are more prevalent in more socially disadvantaged areas. Point-of-sale legislation has led to a reduced visibility of tobacco products in tobacco stores. The effect of the recent legislation in the UK restricting tobacco displays at point-of-sale on retail provision of tobacco is unknown. How tobacco retail outlet density and retail visibility of tobacco interact to influence changes in overall tobacco retail exposure after the introduction of the point-of-sale legislation and how this impacts inequalities has not been explored previously. Legislation in Scotland removing point-of-sale tobacco displays has reduced overall exposure to tobacco products among adolescents but inequalities in availability and visibility have increased. The availability of tobacco in Scotland remains ubiquitous. Achieving the tobacco ‘endgame’ will require strategies that reduce the local provision of tobacco products across the country.

Extracted data were coded to individual, social, and environmental level categories using a modified Theory of Triadic Influence framework. Results A total of 55 studies were included, 41 were descriptive quantitative and 14 qualitative, and 26 included Indigenous participants only. The majority were from the US (32). Frequently reported influences were at the individual and social levels such as increasing age; attitudes and knowledge; substance use; peer and family relationships; smoking norms; mental health; physical activity. At the environmental level, smoke-free spaces; second-hand smoke exposure; high community level prevalence; and social marketing campaigns were also frequently reported. Some studies referenced price, access, and traditional tobacco use. Few reported historical and cultural factors. Conclusions Young Indigenous people experience similar influences to other populations such as smoking among family and friends. Greater youth smoking is related to broader community level prevalence, but few studies explore the distal or historical contributing factors such as traditional tobacco use, colonization, experiences of intergenerational trauma and discrimination, or the role of cultural connection. Implications This review identified a range of factors that influence Indigenous youth smoking and contributes to an understanding of what prevention measures may be effective. Youth tobacco use occurs alongside other substance use and may also serve as an indicator of mental health. Comprehensive community-based programs that work more broadly to address the risk factors related to tobacco, including improving youth mental health, will be important for other behaviors as well. This research highlights the importance of social influence and need for ongoing denormalization of smoking. Future Indigenous led and community owned research is needed to identify likely protective cultural factors.

1689,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Health Care Utilization and Expenditures Attributable to Smokeless Tobacco Use Among US Adults,article,"Introduction This study estimated the health care utilization and expenditures attributable to the use of smokeless tobacco (ST) which includes chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco among US adults aged 18 and older. Methods We used data from the 2012–2015 National Health Interview Surveys (n = 139451 adults) to estimate a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model on four health care utilization measures among US adults (hospital nights, emergency room [ER] visits, doctor visits, and home care visits) specified as a function of tobacco use status, and other covariates. Tobacco use status was classified into four categories: current ST users, former ST users, non-ST tobacco users, and never tobacco users. ST-attributable utilization was calculated based on the estimated ZIP model using an “excess utilization” approach. It was then multiplied by the unit cost estimated from the 2014 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey data to derive ST-attributable health care expenditures. Results During 2012–2015, 2.1% of adults were current ST users and 7.7% were former ST users. ST-attributable health care utilization amounted to 681000 hospital nights, 624000 ER visits, and 4.6 million doctor visits per year (home care visits results were not significant). This resulted in annual excess expenditures of $1.8 billion for hospitalizations, $0.7 billion for ER visits, and $0.9 billion for doctor visits, totaling over $3.4 billion (in 2014 dollars). Conclusion Comprehensive tobacco control policies and interventions are needed to reduce ST use and the associated health care burden. Implications This is the first study to assess the impact of ST use on health care burden in the United States. Findings indicate that excess annual health care expenditures attributable to ST use for US adults were $3.4 billion in 2014 dollars.

2370,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Policy Makers and Consumers Should Prioritize Human Rights to Being Smoke-Free Over Either Tobacco- or Nicotine-Free: Accurate Terms and Relevant Evidence,article,"A holistic approach considers the bigger picture. Observing the right of consumers to health-relevant information can happen today. Observing the right of the world to be tobacco free is for the future, if it ever happens. I prefer also to advocate for a human right for a tobacco-smoke-free world rather than for a tobacco-free world, because the supporting evidence arises most conclusively from the effects of cigarette smoke. In dealing with the “tobacco” epidemic, it would be good public health practice to prioritize attention to the most common and most deadly products (cigarettes), especially when other tobacco products are less common or less important causes of early death and disability and when the harms from some of these other tobacco or nicotine products can be quite low. Of course, such a triage or prioritization does not imply neglect of concerns for other products, but a rather more proportional concern.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz113,,"Kozlowski, Lynn T","Department of Community Health and Health Behavior, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY"
2002,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Addressing Ethnic Disparities in Adolescent Smoking: Is Reducing Exposure to Smoking in the Home a Key?,article,"Introduction Smoking among New Zealand (NZ) adolescents has declined since 2000, but ethnic disparities remain pronounced. To inform prevention efforts, we investigated exposure to and relative importance of known predictors of adolescent smoking and how these have changed over time, for Māori (NZ’s indigenous population) and adolescents overall. Methods We used repeat cross-sectional data, 2003–2015, from a national survey of 14- to 15-year olds (N = 20 443–31 696 per year). For the overall sample and for Māori and non-Māori, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) to assess the association between regular smoking and risk factors each year: one or more parents smoke, best friend smokes, older sibling(s) smoke, and past week exposure to smoking in the home. We calculated population attributable risk (PAR) for risk factors in 2003 and 2015. Results Between 2003 and 2015, aORs for exposure to smoking in the home increased from 1.7 (95% CI 1.6% to 1.8%) to 2.6 (2.1% to 3.1%) overall and from 1.8 (1.6% to 2.1%) to 3.4 (2.5% to 4.5%) for Māori; aORs for “best friend smokes” also increased, while aORs for sibling smoking and parental smoking did not change meaningfully. PAR for exposure to smoking in the home increased from 17% to 31% overall and from 28% to 57% for Māori, while PARs for other risk factors decreased. Conclusions Exposure to smoking in the home has become more strongly associated with adolescent smoking over time and is an increasingly important risk factor at the population level (independent of parental smoking), particularly for Māori. Implications Our findings have implications for reducing smoking uptake and ethnic disparities in NZ, and potentially elsewhere, given the similarity in risk factors and trends for adolescent smoking internationally. Our findings suggest that reducing second-hand smoke exposure in homes will likely reduce uptake of smoking. Because Māori children are both more exposed and appear to be more strongly influenced by exposure to smoking in the home, interventions to reduce indoor smoking could have differentially positive effects for Māori. Greater research and policy attention to reducing smoking in homes is warranted.

1855,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,HIV Care Initiation: A Teachable Moment for Smoking Cessation?,article,"Introduction Tobacco use among persons living with HIV represents an important risk factor for poor treatment outcomes, morbidity, and mortality. Thus, efforts designed to inform the development of appropriate smoking cessation programs for this population remains a public health priority. To address this need, a study was conducted to longitudinally assess the relationship between intention to quit smoking and cessation over the 12-month period following initiation of HIV care. Methods Patients initiating HIV care at a large inner city safety net clinic were enrolled (n = 378) in a 12-month prospective study. Audio computer-assisted self-interviews were conducted at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-enrollment, and HIV-related clinical data were collected from participants’ electronic medical records. Variables of interest included intention to quit smoking, 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence (biochemically verified), and stage of HIV. Data were collected in Houston, Texas from 2009 to 2015. Results The sample was 75% male and 62% Black. Findings indicated that intention to quit smoking increased between baseline and 3 months, and subsequently trended downward from 3 to 12 months. Results from linear and generalized linear mixed models indicated that participants with advanced HIV disease (vs. not advanced) reported significantly (p < .05) higher intention to quit smoking at 3, 6, and 12 months post-study enrollment. A similar though nonsignificant pattern was observed in the smoking abstinence outcome. Conclusions HIV treatment initiation appears to be associated with increases in intention to quit smoking thus serves as a potential teachable moment for smoking cessation intervention. Implications This study documents significant increases in intention to quit smoking in the 3-month period following HIV care initiation. Moreover, quit intention trended downward following the 3-month follow-up until the 12-month follow-up. In addition, a marked effect for HIV disease stage was observed, whereby participants with advanced HIV disease (vs. those without) experienced a greater increase in intention to quit. HIV treatment initiation appears to be associated with increases in intention to quit smoking, thus serves as a crucial teachable moment for smoking cessation intervention for people living with HIV.

77,Tobacco Control,2015,The effect of MPOWER on smoking prevalence,Research Article,"Objective To examine the effect of varying levels of comprehensive tobacco control on smoking in a global context. Methods Using data from WHO's Reports on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, scatter plots were produced to visualise the relationship between comprehensive tobacco control policy (2008 MPOWER composite score) and change in current tobacco smoking between 2006 and 2009. Fixed-effect regression models assessed the effect of changes in each MPOWER measure on changes in current tobacco smoking between 2006 and 2009. All analyses were stratified by sex. Results Overall, countries with higher MPOWER composite scores experienced greater decreases in current tobacco smoking between the years 2006 and 2009. Regression analyses revealed that the M and R measures showed a negative association with current tobacco smoking over time. Current tobacco smoking decreased (1.07 percentage points for males, 1.04 percentage points for females) with each increase in score value for monitoring tobacco use (M). Also, current tobacco smoking decreased (0.95 percentage points for males, 0.41 percentage points for females) with each increase in score value for raising taxes on tobacco (R). The effect of the MPOWER measures on current tobacco smoking varied by country income status (P measure in the female analysis; p<0.05) and/or by WHO region (M, P and O measures in the male analysis; p<0.05). Conclusions Higher levels of MPOWER combined, as well as continued and frequent monitoring of tobacco use (M) and increasing taxation (R), were associated with a decrease in current tobacco smoking over time. ","Single country analyses of the effects of comprehensive tobacco control indicate varying levels of effectiveness. To date, no empirical studies have been published that compare varying levels of MPOWER effects on smoking behaviour across countries. This analysis demonstrates that while the MPOWER package generally works to decrease smoking prevalence, there is a need to explore additional factors that contribute to either promoting or preventing successful reduction.

552,Tobacco Control,2018,A new form of nicotine retailers: a systematic review of the sales and marketing practices of vape shops,Other,"Objective Retailers that primarily or exclusively sell electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping products represent a new category of tobacco retailer. We sought to identify (a) how vape shops can be identified and (b) sales and marketing practices of vape shops. Data sources A medical librarian iteratively developed a search strategy and in February 2017 searched seven academic databases (ABI/INFORM Complete, ECONLit, Embase, Entrepreneurship, PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus). We hand searched Tobacco Regulatory Science and Tobacco Prevention & Cessation. Study selection We used dual, independent screening. Records were eligible if published in 2010 or later, were peer-reviewed journal articles and focused on vape shops. Data extraction We used dual, independent data abstraction and assessed risk of bias. Of the 3605 records identified, 22 were included. Data synthesis We conducted a narrative systematic review. Researchers relied heavily on Yelp to identify vape shops. Vape shop owners use innovative marketing strategies that sometimes diverge from those of traditional tobacco retailers. Vape shop staff believe strongly that their products are effective harm-reduction products. Vape shops were more common in areas with more White residents. Conclusions Vape shops represent a new type of retailer for tobacco products. Vape shops have potential to promote e-cigarettes for smoking cessation but also sometimes provide inaccurate information and mislabelled products. Given their spatial patterning, vape shops may perpetuate inequities in tobacco use. The growing literature on vape shops is complicated by researchers using different definitions of vape shops (eg, exclusively selling e-cigarettes vs also selling traditional tobacco products). ","E-cigarettes are an emerging product with potential for individual harm reduction but also with risks to population health. Vape shops are a new form of retailer selling addictive products. The evidence about the sales and marketing practices of vape shops, as well as methodological concerns about their identification, has not been synthesised.

The Malaysian government has enacted comprehensive measures involving various agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to address health issues related to smoking, by promoting healthy lifestyle campaigns, engaging in advocacy, introducing smoke-free areas, raising the prices of tobacco products by changing the tax structure of cigarettes from kilograms to sticks, and implementing community intervention programs such as KOSPEN (Komuniti Sihat, Pembina Negara — Healthy community, developed the nation)3.

2149,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Anxiety Sensitivity and Distress Tolerance in Smokers: Relations With Tobacco Dependence, Withdrawal, and Quitting Success†",article,"Introduction This study examined relations of two affective vulnerabilities, high anxiety sensitivity (AS) and low distress tolerance (DT), with tobacco dependence, withdrawal, smoking cessation, and pharmacotherapy response. Methods Smokers interested in quitting (N = 1067; 52.2% female, 28.1% African American) were randomized to 12 weeks of nicotine patch, nicotine patch plus nicotine lozenge, or varenicline. Baseline questionnaires assessed AS, DT, negative affect, anxiety, and dependence. Withdrawal was assessed the first-week post-quit via ecological momentary assessment. Results DT, but not AS, predicted biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence at multiple endpoints: weeks 4, 12, 26, and 52 post-quit (ps < .05); relations remained after controlling for pharmacotherapy treatment, AS, baseline negative affect, anxiety, and anxiety disorder history (ps < .05). Additional exploratory analyses examining week 4 abstinence showed DT predicted abstinence (p = .004) even after controlling for baseline dependence, post-quit withdrawal (craving and negative affect), and treatment. DT moderated treatment effects on abstinence in exploratory analyses (interaction p = .025); those with high DT were especially likely to be abstinent at week 4 with patch plus lozenge versus patch alone. Conclusions DT, but not AS, predicted abstinence over 1 year post-quit (higher DT was associated with higher quit rates), with little overlap with other affective measures. DT also predicted early abstinence independent of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Results suggest low DT may play a meaningful role in motivation to use tobacco and constitute an additional affective risk factor for tobacco cessation failure beyond negative affect or clinical affective disorders. Implications People in a stop-smoking study who reported a greater ability to tolerate distress were more likely to quit smoking and remain smoke-free 1 year later. Smokers with high DT were more likely to be smoke-free 4 weeks after their target quit day if they received nicotine patch plus nicotine lozenge rather than nicotine patch alone.

944,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,“Smoker’s Paradox” in Patients Treated for Severe Injuries: Lower Risk of Mortality After Trauma Observed in Current Smokers,article,"Background: Studies evaluating the effect of smoking status on mortality outcomes in trauma patients have been limited, despite the fact that survival benefits of smoking have been reported in other critical care settings. The phenomenon “smoker’s paradox” refers to the observation that following acute cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest, smokers often experience decreased mortality in the hospital setting. The objective of our study was to determine whether smoking imparts a survival benefit in patients with traumatic injuries. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study that analyzed cases included in the National Trauma Data Bank research dataset. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether smoking alters the risk of mortality and complications in patients who smoke. Results:  The percentage of patients experiencing mortality differed significantly between smokers ( n = 38,564) and nonsmokers ( n = 319,249) (1.8% vs. 4.3%, P < .001); however, the percentage experiencing a major complication did not (9.7% vs. 9.6%, P = .763). Regression analyses indicated that smokers were significantly less likely to die during the hospital stay compared to nonsmokers after adjusting for individual and hospital factors ( OR = 0.15; CI = 0.10, 0.22). Additionally, smokers were also less likely to develop a major complication than nonsmokers ( OR = 0.73, CI = 0.59–0.91).  Conclusions: Patients who smoke appear to have a much lower risk of in-hospital mortality than nonsmokers. Further investigation into biological mechanisms responsible for this effect should be carried out in order to potentially develop therapeutic applications.

1148,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,General Practitioners and Dentists: A Call for Action Against Tobacco,article,"Introduction: To investigate the frequency of advice to quit smoking received by the Italian population from general practitioners (GP) and dentists, we analyzed a cross-sectional study. Methods: A face-to-face survey was conducted in 2014 on 3052 individuals, representative of the general Italian population aged 15 years or more. Results: During the previous year, 89% of individuals (82% of smokers) reported that they had visited a GP while 71% (67% of smokers) had visited a dentist. Among smokers, 25% reported that they had received advice to quit smoking from their GP, and 26% from their dentist. Advice by GPs was less frequently received by smokers with higher education (multivariate odds ratios (OR) were 0.48 for intermediate and 0.38 for high as compared to low education), and more frequently by heavy smokers (≥15 cigarettes/day; OR = 1.78), those with intention to quit (OR = 2.59), with previous quit attempts (OR = 2.09), and those aware of the existence of smoking cessation services (OR = 1.59). Advice by dentists was more frequently received by smokers aged 25–44 years (OR = 3.55 compared to those aged 15–24) and those with an intention to quit (OR = 2.46). Among Italian current smokers, 32% reported that their GP and 17% that their dentist was a current smoker. The corresponding figures among young smokers were 40% and 26%, respectively. Conclusion: Healthcare providers have the potential to become a key reference point in the fight against smoking. However, before acting, GPs and dentists should set a good example: those who smoke should urgently quit or at least refrain from smoking during working hours. Implications: GPs and dentists, reaching the large majority of Italian smokers, can make a major contribution in the fight against tobacco. Future studies are needed to investigate possible reasons of the apparently high smoking prevalence among GPs, in order to develop tailored smoking cessation interventions for healthcare providers.

9,Tobacco Control,2015,How do policy advisors and practitioners prioritise the protection of children from secondhand smoke exposure in a country with advanced tobacco control policy?,Research Article,"Objectives The aim is to extend understanding of the policy and practice discourses that inform the development of national tobacco control policy to protect children from secondhand smoke exposure (SHSE) in the home, particularly in a country with successful implementation of smoke-free public places legislation. The Scottish experience will contribute to the tobacco control community, particularly those countries at a similar level of tobacco control, as normalising discourses about protecting children from SHSE are becoming more widespread. Design Case study design using qualitative interviews and focus groups (FGs) with policy makers, health and childcare practitioners during which they were presented with the findings of the Reducing Families' Exposure to Secondhand Smoke (REFRESH) intervention and discussed the implications for their policy and practice priorities. Setting Scotland, UK Participants Qualitative interviews and FGs were conducted with 30 policy makers and practitioners who were purposively recruited. Results Participants accepted the harm of SHSE to children; however, action is limited by political expedience due to—the perception of a shift of the public health priority from smoking to alcohol, current financial constraints, more immediate child protection concerns and continuing unresolved ethical arguments. Conclusions In a country, such as Scotland, with advanced tobacco control strategies, there continue to be challenges to policy and practice development in the more contentious arena of the home. Children's SHSE in their homes is unequivocally accepted as an important health priority, but it is not currently perceived to be a top public health priority in Scotland. ","REFRESH key findings Providing mothers who smoke with personalised data about the air quality in their homes, together with a motivational interview, is feasible and has an effect on improving air quality measures at 1 month.

The intervention was understandable and acceptable. REFRESH, Reducing Families' Exposure to Secondhand Smoke. Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is an important cause of morbidity in children, who are most often exposed in their homes, particularly in disadvantaged homes. Most parents want to protect their children from harm and many homes have some form of smoking restriction, but these restrictions are often flexible in their implementation. Policy advisors and practitioners are challenged by developing public health interventions in the private space of the home. The implementation of smoke-free public places in Scotland did not increase children's SHS exposure in the home. Policy advisors and practitioners accepted the harms caused by children's exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS). They supported an incremental policy approach, not requiring legislation, which would aim to increase the unacceptability of exposing children to SHS. Taking action to protect children from exposure to SHS in the private space of the home was problematic for both policy and practice. Protecting children from SHS was linked to competing child protection concerns. Immediate child protection concerns were prioritised over SHS exposure of children in the practice arena. Ethical considerations remain unresolved in the policy and practice arenas. The right to health for children does not prevail over the autonomy of parents to smoke in the private space of their homes.

The extent to which smokers’ social networks change after a quit attempt is unknown, as is the relation between quitting success and later network changes. Methods: Unique types of social networks for 691 smokers enrolled in a smoking-cessation trial were identified based on network size, new network members, members’ smoking habits, within network smoking, smoking buddies, and romantic partners’ smoking. Latent transition analysis was used to identify the network classes and to predict transitions in class membership across 3 years from biochemically assessed smoking abstinence. Results: Five network classes were identified: Immersed (large network, extensive smoking exposure including smoking buddies), Low Smoking Exposure (large network, minimal smoking exposure), Smoking Partner (small network, smoking exposure primarily from partner), Isolated (small network, minimal smoking exposure), and Distant Smoking Exposure (small network, considerable nonpartner smoking exposure). Abstinence at years 1 and 2 was associated with shifts in participants’ social networks to less contact with smokers and larger networks in years 2 and 3. Conclusions: In the years following a smoking-cessation attempt, smokers’ social networks changed, and abstinence status predicted these changes. Networks defined by high levels of exposure to smokers were especially associated with continued smoking. Abstinence, however, predicted transitions to larger social networks comprising less smoking exposure. These results support treatments that aim to reduce exposure to smoking cues and smokers, including partners who smoke. Implications: Prior research has shown that social network features predict the likelihood of subsequent smoking cessation. The current research illustrates how successful quitting predicts social network change over 3 years following a quit attempt. Specifically, abstinence predicts transitions to networks that are larger and afford less exposure to smokers. This suggests that quitting smoking may expand a person’s social milieu rather than narrow it. This effect, plus reduced exposure to smokers, may help sustain abstinence.

251,Tobacco Control,2016,Tobacco imagery in video games: ratings and gamer recall,Research Article,"Objective To assess whether tobacco content found in video games was appropriately labelled for tobacco-related content by the Entertainment and Software Ratings Board (ESRB). Methods Sixty-five gamer participants (self-identified age range 13–50) were interviewed in-person (n=25) or online (n=40) and asked (A) to list favourite games and (B) to name games that they could recall containing tobacco content. The ESRB database was searched for all games mentioned to ascertain whether they had been assigned tobacco-related content descriptors. Games were independently assessed for tobacco content by examining user-created game wiki sites and watching YouTube videos of gameplay. Games with tobacco-related ESRB content descriptors and/or with tobacco imagery verified by researchers were considered to contain tobacco content. Games identified by participants as including tobacco but lacking verifiable tobacco content were treated as not containing tobacco content. Results Participants recalled playing 140 unique games, of which 118 were listed in the ESRB database. Participants explicitly recalled tobacco content in 31% (37/118) of the games, of which 94% (35/37) included independently verified tobacco content. Only 8% (9/118) of the games had received ESRB tobacco-related content descriptors, but researchers verified that 42% (50/118) contained such content; 42% (49/118) of games were rated ‘M’ for mature (content deemed appropriate for ages 17+). Of these, 76% (37/49) contained verified tobacco content; however, only 4% (2/49) received ESRB tobacco-related content descriptors. Conclusions Gamers are exposed to tobacco imagery in many video games. The ESRB is not a reliable source for determining whether video games contain tobacco imagery. ","Exposure to smoking imagery in movies has been positively linked to adolescent smoking initiation, providing the basis for the hypothesis that smoking imagery from other media sources may be similarly implicated.

2173,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Exposure to a Tobacco-Specific Carcinogen Among Adolescent Smokeless Tobacco Users in Rural California, United States",article,"Introduction Approximately the same percentage of male high school students in the United States currently uses conventional smokeless tobacco as smokes cigarettes, resulting in toxin exposure. Methods This study assessed tobacco product use (smokeless, combustible, and electronic cigarettes) and nicotine and carcinogen exposures in a sample of 594 male rural high school baseball players—a population traditionally at risk for smokeless tobacco use. Salivary specimens were assayed for cotinine (a biomarker of nicotine exposure) and urine specimens for 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL, a biomarker of the carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Results The prevalence of past 30-day use of any tobacco product was 29%. Past 7-day smokeless tobacco use (prevalence: 13%) was associated with the highest levels of cotinine and NNAL observed in the sample, whether smokeless tobacco was used exclusively (geometric means: cotinine 11.1 ng/mL; NNAL 31.9 pg/mg-creatinine) or in combination with combustible products (geometric means: cotinine 31.6 ng/mL; NNAL 50.0 pg/mg creatinine). Cotinine and NNAL levels were incrementally higher in each increasing category of smokeless tobacco use frequency. However, observed levels were lower than previously reported for adults, likely reflecting less smokeless use per day among adolescents. Conclusions Based on these biomarker observations, adolescents who use conventional smokeless tobacco products are exposed to substantial levels of nicotine and NNK. Although exposed to lower levels than adult smokeless users, the findings are concerning given the young age of the sample and tendency for smokeless tobacco users to increase use intensity over time. Implications This study demonstrates that adolescents using smokeless tobacco are exposed to levels of nicotine and NNK that increase with use frequency and that exceed exposures among peers using other tobacco products. Youth smokeless tobacco use in the United States has not declined along with youth smoking prevalence, giving greater importance to this health concern. To reduce youth (and adult) exposures, needed actions include effective smokeless tobacco use prevention, potentially in combination with reducing the levels of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals in smokeless tobacco products currently popular among adolescents.

The development of combustible cigarette smoking requires the initiation of smoking and a subsequent chain of behavioral transitions from experimental use, to established regular use, to the conversion to addiction. Each transition is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, and our increasing knowledge about genetic contributions to smoking behaviors opens new potential interventions. Methods This review describes the journey from genetic discovery to the potential implementation of genetic knowledge for the treatment of tobacco use disorder. Results and Conclusions The field of genetics applied to smoking behaviors has rapidly progressed with the identification of highly validated genetic variants that are associated with different smoking behaviors. The large scale implementation of this genetic knowledge to accelerate smoking cessation represents an important clinical challenge in precision medicine.

1807,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Acute Effects of a Dopamine D3 Receptor Preferring Agonist on Motivation for Cigarettes in Dependent and Occasional Cigarette Smokers,article,"Background Dopaminergic functioning is thought to play critical roles in both motivation and addiction. There is preliminary evidence that dopamine agonists reduce the motivation for cigarettes in smokers. However, the effects of pramipexole, a dopamine D3 receptor preferring agonist, have not been investigated. Methods Twenty dependent and 20 occasional smokers received 0.5 mg pramipexole using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Motivation for cigarettes and consummatory nondrug rewards was measured using the DReaM-Choice task, in which participants earned, and later “consumed,” cigarettes, music, and chocolate. Demand for cigarettes was measured using the Cigarette Purchase Task (CPT). Self-reported craving, withdrawal, and drug effects were also recorded. Results Dependent smokers chose (p < .001) and button-pressed for (p < .001) cigarettes more, and chose chocolate less (p < .001), than occasional smokers. Pramipexole did not affect the number of choices for or amount of button-pressing for any reward including cigarettes, which was supported by a Bayesian analysis. The dependent smokers had greater demand for cigarettes than occasional smokers across all CPT outcomes (ps < .021), apart from elasticity. Pramipexole did not affect demand for cigarettes, and this was supported by Bayesian analyses. Pramipexole produced greater subjective “feel drug” and “dislike drug” effects than placebo. Conclusions Dependent and occasional cigarette smokers differed in their motivation for cigarettes but not for the nondrug rewards. Pramipexole did not acutely alter motivation for cigarettes. These findings question the role of dopamine D3 receptors in cigarette-seeking behavior in dependent and occasional smokers. Implications This study adds to the growing literature about cigarette versus nondrug reward processing in nicotine dependence and the role of dopamine in cigarette-seeking behavior. Our results suggest nicotine dependence is associated with a hypersensitivity to cigarette rewards but not a hyposensitivity to nondrug rewards. Furthermore, our results question the importance of dopamine D3 receptors in motivational processing of cigarettes in occasional and dependent smokers.

68,Tobacco Control,2015,"Economic evaluation of a hospital-initiated intervention for smokers with chronic disease, in Ontario, Canada",Research Article,"Introduction Cigarette smoking causes many chronic diseases that are costly and result in frequent hospitalisation. Hospital-initiated smoking cessation interventions increase the likelihood that patients will become smoke-free. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC), an intervention that includes in-hospital counselling, pharmacotherapy and posthospital follow-up, compared to usual care among smokers hospitalised with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), heart failure (HF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods We completed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a decision-analytic model to assess smokers hospitalised in Ontario, Canada for AMI, UA, HF, and COPD, their risk of continuing to smoke and the effects of quitting on re-hospitalisation and mortality over a 1-year period. We calculated short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness ratios. Our primary outcome was 1-year cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results From the hospital payer's perspective, delivery of the OMSC can be considered cost effective with 1-year cost per QALY gained of $C1386, and lifetime cost per QALY gained of $C68. In the first year, we calculated that provision of the OMSC to 15 326 smokers would generate 4689 quitters, and would prevent 116 rehospitalisations, 923 hospital days, and 119 deaths. Results were robust within numerous sensitivity analyses. Discussion The OMSC appears to be cost-effective from the hospital payer perspective. Important consideration is the relatively low intervention cost compared to the reduction in costs related to readmissions for illnesses associated with continued smoking. ","Most hospitals fail to offer tobacco cessation interventions due, in part, to concerns about the perceived costs of such programs. Cost-effectiveness analyses provide health care administrators with information needed to guide the allocation of resources. This study demonstrated that hospital-initiated smoking cessation interventions, like the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation, can be implemented with relatively small investment and can be extremely cost-effective when applied to high risk smokers with existing chronic disease. Given the known benefits of smoking cessation on morbidity and mortality, cessation interventions should be adopted by hospitals regardless of their ability to save money. If these interventions result in cost-savings, this should be seen simply as favourable consequence of helping people to quit.

Methods Smoking rooms in the four largest international airports that serve the most travellers and with the most operating designated smoking rooms (DSRs) were monitored using PM2.5 monitoring equipment following an approved research protocol for assessing fine particle pollution from tobacco smoke. Monitoring was conducted inside and just outside DSRs and throughout the airport terminals in all four airports. Altogether 104 samples were taken to assess SHS exposure in four airports. Simultaneous samples were taken multiple times in a total of 11 DSRs available for sampling in the research period. Results Levels of PM2.5 in DSRs were extremely high in all four airports and were more dangerous inside DSRs than in the US airports (overall mean=532.5 vs 188.7 µg/m3), higher outside DSRs than in the US airports (overall mean=50.1 vs 43.7 µg/m3), and at comparable levels with the US airports in the terminals away from DSRs (overall mean=13.8 vs 11.5 µg/m3. Findings show that travellers and employees in or near DSRs in the airports assessed in Thailand are being exposed to even higher levels of SHS than in US airports that still have DSRs. Conclusions Extremely high levels of SHS in and adjacent to DSR show that these rooms are not providing safe air quality for employees and travellers. These high levels of exposure are above those levels reported in US airports and show the need for remedial action to ensure safe air quality in international airports in Thailand.

1572,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Perinatal Biochemical Confirmation of Smoking Status by Trimester,article,"Introduction: Tobacco use during pregnancy is the most modifiable risk factor associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Self-reported tobacco use has been demonstrated to have high misclassification rates. The aims were to examine misclassification rates of perinatal tobacco use during each trimester of pregnancy and 8 weeks postpartum, and to evaluate characteristics associated with misclassification of tobacco use status. Methods: This is secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter trial of pregnant women, and it includes participants who were biochemically identified as tobacco users during their first trimester (N = 103). Each trimester and once postpartum, tobacco use was assessed via self-report and validated using a cutoff of 100 ng/mL for urine cotinine via NicAlert test strips to indicate current use. Those who self-reported as nonusers but were identified as users via urine cotinine were considered misclassified; misclassification rates were determined for each time period. Logistic regression assessed maternal factors associated with misclassification status. Results: Misclassification rates declined from 35.0% at first trimester to 31.9% and 26.6% at the second and third; the postpartum rate was 30.4%. These rates did not differ significantly from each other at the 0.05 level. Race/ethnicity was associated with misclassification status; white/non-Hispanic women were 87% less likely to be misclassified (p < .001). Conclusion: Misclassification of prenatal smoking status decreases as pregnancy progresses, though the observed rate change was not significant. Minority women may be at particular risk for non-disclosure of tobacco use. Biochemical validation should be considered when assessing perinatal tobacco use via self-report, given high misclassification rates throughout the perinatal period. Implications: These results demonstrate that regardless of trimester, more than one-quarter of tobacco-using pregnant women may not disclose tobacco use throughout pregnancy and early postpartum. Although the rate of misclassification decreased from first to third trimester and then increased in the immediate postpartum, these changes in misclassification rates were not significant. Minority groups may be at particular risk of misclassification compared with white/non-Hispanic women. Biochemical validation is warranted throughout pregnancy to encourage cessation as tobacco use is one of the most easily-modified risk factors for poor birth outcomes.

This study investigates ever use of nicotine and nonnicotine e-cigarettes and examines the demographic and behavioral correlates of e-cigarette use in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Data for 2,892 high school students were derived from the 2013 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey. This province-wide school-based survey is based on a 2-stage cluster design. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to investigate the factors associated with ever use of e-cigarettes. Ever use of e-cigarettes was derived from the question, “Have you ever smoked at least one puff from an electronic cigarette?” All analyses included appropriate adjustments for the complex study design. Results: Fifteen percent of high school students reported using e-cigarettes in their lifetime. Most students who ever used e-cigarettes reported using e-cigarettes without nicotine (72%), but 28% had used e-cigarettes with nicotine. Male, White/Caucasian, and rural students, as well as those with a history of using tobacco cigarettes, were at greater odds of e-cigarette use. Seven percent of students who had never smoked a tobacco cigarette in their lifetime reported using an e-cigarette. Five percent of those who had ever used an e-cigarette had never smoked a tobacco cigarette. Conclusion: More students reported ever using e-cigarettes without nicotine than with nicotine in Ontario, Canada.

Methods Three studies of ‘herbal’ shisha were conducted: (1) samples of ‘herbal’ shisha products were chemically analysed; (2) ‘herbal’ and tobacco shisha were burned in a waterpipe smoking machine and main and sidestream smoke analysed by standard methods and (3) the air quality of six waterpipe cafés was assessed by measurement of CO, particulate and nicotine vapour content. Results We found considerable variation in heavy metal content between the three products sampled, one being particularly high in lead, chromium, nickel and arsenic. A similar pattern emerged for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Smoke emission analyses indicated that toxic byproducts produced by the combustion of ‘herbal’ shisha were equivalent or greater than those produced by tobacco shisha. The results of our air quality assessment demonstrated that mean PM2.5 levels and CO content were significantly higher in waterpipe establishments compared to a casino where cigarette smoking was permitted. Nicotine vapour was detected in one of the waterpipe cafés. Conclusions ‘Herbal’ shisha products tested contained toxic trace metals and PAHs levels equivalent to, or in excess of, that found in cigarettes. Their mainstream and sidestream smoke emissions contained carcinogens equivalent to, or in excess of, those of tobacco products. The content of the air in the waterpipe cafés tested was potentially hazardous. These data, in aggregate, suggest that smoking ‘herbal’ shisha may well be dangerous to health.

1147,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Stigmatic and Sympathetic Attitudes Toward Cancer Patients Who Smoke: A Qualitative Analysis of an Online Discussion Board Forum,article,"Introduction: A significant minority of patients continue to smoke after a cancer diagnosis. Cancer patients who smoke experience stigma that can negatively impact health outcomes. We explored publicly shared perspectives about cancer patients who continued to smoke post-diagnosis. Methods: An online news article, published in January 2012, summarized the findings of smoking prevalence among patients with lung cancer and colorectal cancer enrolled in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium trial. In response, written comments were posted on the articles’ public discussion board. Applying principles of grounded theory, we conducted a document analysis and established a conceptual framework to develop a model by which to explain factors underlying stigmatic and sympathetic attitudes toward cancer survivors who continue to smoke. Results: Personal experiences with cancer, smoking, and statistical literacy were found to influence beliefs about cancer and smoking, which in turn influenced stigmatic or sympathetic attitudes. More sympathetic attitudes were expressed by individuals who had personal experiences with smoking, believed cancer is multicausal, identified smoking as an addiction, or considered extrinsic factors responsible for smoking. Individuals who did not have personal experiences with cancer or smoking, had low statistical literacy, believed that smoking necessarily and directly causes cancer, and focused on intrinsic responsibilities for smoking tended to express more stigmatic attitudes. Conclusions: The current findings raise awareness and provide insight into stigma against cancer survivors who smoke and can help inform strategies for reducing stigma against this vulnerable group. Implications: This study helps raise awareness of stigma toward cancer patients who smoke and provides insight into the processes that may influence stigmatic as compared to sympathetic attitudes toward these patients. Results suggest that population-based strategies to educate the public regarding the nature of nicotine addiction, difficulty of quitting, and benefits of quitting for cancer patients may be useful for reducing stigma against cancer patients with a smoking history.

1577,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Reward Processing and Smoking,article,"Tobacco addiction is a chronic brain disorder that is characterized by a negative affective state and craving for tobacco products upon smoking cessation, and relapse after a period of abstinence. However, we still do not fully understand the neurobiological mechanisms of why people smoke, and why they find it hard to quit. We do know that nicotine, particularly when consumed via cigarettes, is one of the most addictive drugs, and almost half the people who experiment with cigarettes become addicted to nicotine. Prolonged nicotine use leads to the development of dependence and compulsive smoking. Repeated administration of nicotine facilitates stimulus-response learning and sensitizes the response to nicotine, which plays a role in the transition for experimenting with cigarettes to habitual smoking. Smoking cues also lead to drug seeking and play a critical role in relapse. Recent evidence suggests that acute and protracted withdrawal symptoms lead to nicotine craving and contribute to relapse. During the last few decades, animal studies have greatly contributed to a better understanding of the neurobiology of nicotine addiction. The work of Markou and colleagues has provided important insight into the effects of nicotine withdrawal on mood states. The Markou laboratory has used the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure to investigate the effects of nicotine withdrawal on mood. These studies have shown that acute nicotine administration increases the sensitivity to rewarding electrical stimuli. In contrast, cessation of nicotine administration leads to a decrease in sensitivity to rewarding electrical stimuli. This indicates that acute nicotine administration enhances reward function and that cessation of nicotine administration leads to a decrease in the reward value of nondrug reinforcers. The effect of nicotine withdrawal on cognition has not been as thoroughly investigated in animal models. However, there is evidence that nicotine withdrawal impairs cognitive function in rodents. There is a clear need for further fundamental research in both animal models and humans to better understand the mechanisms of tobacco use and dependence. The research presented in this issue provides new insights, with a particular focus on anhedonia and cognition.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntw303,,"Bruijnzeel, Adriaan W.","Department of Psychiatry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"
918,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Reinforcing Effects of Nicotine in Humans and Nonhuman Primates: A Review of Intravenous Self-Administration Evidence and Future Directions for Research,article,"Introduction: Cigarette smoking is largely driven by the reinforcing properties of nicotine. Intravenous (IV) self-administration procedures are the gold standard for investigating the reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs. The goal of this review was to examine the results of published investigations of the reinforcing effects of nicotine measured using IV self-administration procedures in humans and nonhuman primates. Results: The body of literature using nonhuman primate subjects indicates nicotine functions as a positive reinforcer when available for self-administration via IV catheters. However, it can also be difficult to establish IV nicotine self-administration in nonhuman primates and sometimes supplemental strategies have been required (e.g., priming injections or food deprivation) before subjects acquire the behavior. Although the body of literature using human subjects is limited, the evidence indicates nicotine functions as a reinforcer via the IV route of administration in adult cigarette smokers. Rates of nicotine self-injection can be variable across subjects and responding is sometimes inconsistent across sessions in both humans and nonhuman primates. Conclusions: The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, enacted in 2009, gave the Food and Drug Administration regulatory authority over the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Research examining the threshold reinforcing doses for initiation and maintenance of nicotine self-administration, comparisons of the reinforcing effects of nicotine in adolescent versus adult subjects, investigations of gender differences in the reinforcing effects of nicotine, and studies of the abuse liability of non-nicotine tobacco product constituents and their ability to alter the reinforcing effects of nicotine will inform potential tobacco regulatory actions.

Subsequently, a group of scientists led by Ovide F. Pomerleau, John R. Hughes, and John A. Rosecrans believed that the time was right to create a scientific society devoted exclusively to ethical research on nicotine and tobacco science. Up to that point, time devoted to nicotine and tobacco science was limited to 2–4 hour blocks allocated at the annual meetings of scientific societies such as the Society for Behavioral Medicine (SBM), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the American Public Health Association (APHA). Many of those involved in the discussions at the time felt that more time was needed to focus on nicotine and tobacco and engage in discussion and debate surrounding the science of chronic tobacco use including etiology and treatment. The first annual meeting of scientists with a concentrated focus on tobacco science convened under the aegis of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) was subsequently held in conjunction with an SBM conference in San Diego in 1995 with more than 200 people in attendance.",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/nty229,,"Swan, Gary E","Stanford Prevention Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA"
1106,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Effect of Survey Nonresponse on Quitline Abstinence Rates: Implications for Practice,article,"Introduction: Quitline outcome studies are used to maintain and improve the effectiveness of these evidence-based cessation services. Nonresponse has the potential to bias survey results and many US and Canadian quitlines are reporting survey response rates below 50%. This study examines the effect of nonresponse bias on quit rates in three state quitline populations. Results provide implications of nonresponse bias for quitline practice. Methods: Quit status, defined as abstinent for 30 days or more 7 months after registering for services, was collected from Minnesota, Hawaii, and Florida quitline participants that responded to a survey. We assigned each responder to a wave based on the number of contacts required to obtain a survey response. Results: The latest two responder groups had the lowest quit rates within each state, although results were not statistically significant. Quit rates in the latest responder wave (Wave 6) were between 4% and 13% points lower than the earliest responders (Wave 1). The cumulative quit rates show what the quit rate would have been had the study ended after the corresponding wave. In all four studies, the cumulative quit rate was lowest in Wave 6. Conclusion: To increase accuracy of quit rates, quitlines should focus on increasing survey response rates. Suggestions for improving survey response rates are provided.

129,Tobacco Control,2015,"Toxicant content, physical properties and biological activity of waterpipe tobacco smoke and its tobacco-free alternatives",Research Article,"Objectives Waterpipe smoking using sweetened, flavoured tobacco products has become a widespread global phenomenon. In this paper, we review chemical, physical and biological properties of waterpipe smoke. Data sources Peer-reviewed publications indexed in major databases between 1991 and 2014. Search keywords included a combination of: waterpipe, narghile, hookah, shisha along with names of chemical compounds and classes of compounds, in addition to terms commonly used in cellular biology and aerosol sizing. Study selection The search was limited to articles published in English which reported novel data on waterpipe tobacco smoke (WTS) toxicant content, biological activity or particle size and which met various criteria for analytical rigour including: method specificity and selectivity, precision, accuracy and recovery, linearity, range, and stability. Data extraction Multiple researchers reviewed the reports and collectively agreed on which data were pertinent for inclusion. Data synthesis Waterpipe smoke contains significant concentrations of toxicants thought to cause dependence, heart disease, lung disease and cancer in cigarette smokers, and includes 27 known or suspected carcinogens. Waterpipe smoke is a respirable aerosol that induces cellular responses associated with pulmonary and arterial diseases. Except nicotine, smoke generated using tobacco-free preparations marketed for ‘health conscious’ users contains the same or greater doses of toxicants, with the same cellular effects as conventional products. Toxicant yield data from the analytical laboratory are consistent with studies of exposure biomarkers in waterpipe users. Conclusions A sufficient evidence base exists to support public health interventions that highlight the fact that WTS presents a serious inhalation hazard. ","A small but growing literature on maassel waterpipe smoke toxicants has developed over the past decade to address this global, rapidly growing tobacco use method. Reports of waterpipe toxicants and properties have not yet been compiled or compared comprehensively. Waterpipe smoke has been found to contain significant quantities of several toxicant classes, including nicotine and 27 known or suspected carcinogens. Waterpipe smoke is deleterious to human lung and arterial cells. Except for nicotine, smoke from tobacco-free waterpipe products has the same toxicant content and biological activity as that from tobacco-based products. Where data are available, exposure biomarker studies in waterpipe users corroborate patterns in toxicant yields reported in studies of waterpipe smoke.

907,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Factors Associated With Electronic Cigarette Users’ Device Preferences and Transition From First Generation to Advanced Generation Devices,article,"Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are becoming increasingly popular but little is known about how e-cig users’ transition between the different device types and what device characteristics and preferences may influence the transition. Methods: Four thousand four hundred twenty-one experienced e-cig users completed an online survey about their e-cig use, devices, and preferences. Participants included in analysis were ever cigarette smokers who used an e-cig at least 30 days in their lifetime and who reported the type of their first and current e-cig device and the nicotine concentration of their liquid. Analyses focused on transitions between “first generation” devices (same size as a cigarette with no button) and “advanced generation” devices (larger than a cigarette with a manual button) and differences between current users of each device type. Results: Most e-cig users (n = 2603, 58.9%) began use with a first generation device, and of these users, 63.7% subsequently transitioned to current use of an advanced generation device. Among users who began use with an advanced generation device (n = 1818, 41.1%), only 5.7% transitioned to a first generation device. Seventy-seven percent of current advanced generation e-cig users switched to their current device in order to obtain a “more satisfying hit.” Battery capabilities and liquid flavor choices also influenced device choice. Conclusion: E-cig users commonly begin use with a device shaped like a cigarette and transition to a larger device with a more powerful battery, a button for manual activation and a wider choice of liquid flavors.

1365,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Risk-Continuum Categorization of Product Use Among US Youth Tobacco Users,article,"Introduction: To examine prevalence and correlates of five mutually exclusive tobacco-use patterns among US youth tobacco users. Methods:  A nationally representative sample of tobacco users ( N = 3202, 9–17 years) was classified into five product-use patterns. Weighted multinominal and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine prevalence of product-use patterns by gender, race and ethnicity, and grade level; and associations between product-use patterns and perceived accessibility of tobacco products, exposure and receptivity to pro-tobacco marketing, social benefits of smoking, and tobacco-associated risks.  Results:  Dual use (ie, use of two product categories) was the most prevalent pattern (30.5%), followed by non-cigarette combustible only (26.7%), polytobacco (ie, use of three product categories; 17.5%), cigarette only (14.9%), and noncombustible only (10.4%) use. Product-use patterns differed by gender, race, and ethnicity. Compared to cigarette only users, dual and polytobacco users were more likely to be exposed to and be receptive to pro-tobacco marketing, and were less likely to acknowledge tobacco-use related risks ( P s < .05).  Conclusions: Curbing tobacco use warrants research on users of more than one tobacco-product categories according to the risk-continuum categorization. Implications: We present a risk-continuum categorization of product-use patterns among tobacco users not older than 17 years. We classify tobacco users into five mutually exclusive product-use patterns: cigarette only users, non-cigarette combustible only users, noncombustible only users, dual use, and polytobacco use. This categorization overcomes limitations in current literature on tobacco-use patterns, which include exclusion of certain products (eg, e-cigarettes) and product-use patterns (eg, exclusive users of non-cigarette products), and inconsistent classification of tobacco users. It is parsimonious yet complex enough to retain differential characteristics of sub-tobacco users based on number (single, dual, polytobacco) and categories (cigarettes, non-cigarette combustibles, noncombustibles) of tobacco products consumed.

Methods Through the Twitter Firehose, we obtained access to all public tweets posted between 6 December 2012 and 20 June 2013 that contained a keyword suggesting a tobacco-related product or behaviour (eg, cigarette, vaping) in addition to a keyword suggesting a price promotion (eg, coupon, discount). From this data set of 155 249 tweets, we constructed a stratified sampling frame based on the price-related keywords and randomly sampled 5000 tweets (3.2%). Tweets were coded for product type and promotion type. Non-English tweets and tweets unrelated to a tobacco or cessation price promotion were excluded, leaving an analytic sample of 2847 tweets. Results The majority of tweets (97.0%) mentioned tobacco products while 3% mentioned tobacco cessation products. E-cigarettes were the most frequently mentioned product (90.1%), followed by cigarettes (5.4%). The most common type of price promotion mentioned across all products was a discount. About a third of all e-cigarette-related tweets included a discount code. Banned or restricted price promotions comprised about 3% of cigarette-related tweets. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the vast majority of tweets offering price promotions focus on e-cigarettes.

326,Tobacco Control,2017,Increasing the dose of television advertising in a national antismoking media campaign: results from a randomised field trial,Research Article,"Background While antismoking media campaigns have demonstrated effectiveness, less is known about the country-level effects of increased media dosing. The 2012 US Tips From Former Smokers (Tips) campaign generated approximately 1.6 million quit attempts overall; however, the specific dose–response from the campaign was only assessed by self-report. Objective Assess the impact of higher ad exposure during the 2013 Tips campaign on quit-related behaviours and intentions, campaign awareness, communication about campaign, and disease knowledge. Methods A 3-month national media buy was supplemented within 67 (of 190) randomly selected local media markets. Higher-dose markets received media buys 3 times that of standard-dose markets. We compared outcomes of interest using data collected via web-based surveys from nationally representative, address-based probability samples of 5733 cigarette smokers and 2843 non-smokers. Results In higher-dose markets, 87.2% of smokers and 83.9% of non-smokers recalled television campaign exposure versus 75.0% of smokers and 73.9% of non-smokers in standard-dose markets. Among smokers overall, the relative quit attempt rate was 11% higher in higher-dose markets (38.8% vs 34.9%; p<0.04). The higher-dose increase was larger in African-Americans (50.9% vs 31.8%; p<0.01). Smokers in higher-dose markets without a mental health condition, with a chronic health condition, or with only some college education made quit attempts at a higher rate than those in standard-dose markets. Non-smokers in higher-dose markets were more likely to talk with family or friends about smoking dangers (43.1% vs 35.7%; p<0.01) and had greater knowledge of smoking-related diseases. Conclusions The US 2013 Tips antismoking media campaign compared standard and higher doses by randomisation of local media markets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of a higher dose for engaging non-smokers and further increasing quit attempts among smokers, especially African-Americans. ","Tobacco control strategies, including public education campaigns, have been shown to be effective in promoting behavioural changes, including incidence of quit attempts.

965,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Electronic Cigarettes Are a Source of Thirdhand Exposure to Nicotine,article,"Introduction: Substances remaining on the surfaces in areas where people have smoked contribute to thirdhand exposure. Nicotine from tobacco smoke has been shown to react with oxidizing chemicals in the air to form secondary pollutants, such as carcinogenic nitrosamines. While prev ious studies have demonstrated thirdhand exposure to nicotine from tobacco smoke, none have investigated whether nicotine from electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) can also be deposited on various surfaces. Methods: Three brands of e-cigarettes were refilled with varying nicotine concentrations. We released 100 puffs from each product directly into an exposure chamber. Surface wipe samples were taken from 5 indoor 100cm2 surfaces (window, walls, floor, wood, and metal) pre- and post-release of vapors. Nicotine was extracted from the wipes and was analyzed using gas chromatography. Results: Three of the 4 experiments showed significant increases in the amount of nicotine on all five surfaces. The floor and glass windows had the greatest increases in nicotine, on average by a factor of 47 and 6, respectively (p < .05). The average amount of nicotine deposited on a floor during each experiment was 205 μg/m2 and varied from limit of quantitation to 550 μg/m2. Conclusions: This study indicates that there is a risk for thirdhand exposure to nicotine from e-cigarettes. Thirdhand exposure levels differ depending on the surface and the e-cigarette brand. Future research should explore the potential risks of thirdhand exposure to carcinogens formed from the nicotine that is released from e-cigarettes.

1870,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,"Marketing Exposure Recall is Associated With Past 30-Day Single, Dual, Polytobacco Use Among US Adolescents",article,"Introduction This study assesses the relationship between tobacco/e-cigarette marketing exposure and single, dual, and polytobacco product use, among adolescents. Given the increased use of noncigarette tobacco products (eg, cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah) among youth, it is imperative to understand if marketing exposure is associated with dual and polytobacco product use. Methods Data were obtained from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey and weighted to be representative of US middle and high school students. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the relationships between product marketing (via internet, print, retail, and TV/movies) and past 30-day single, dual, and poly (three or more) tobacco product use. Three analyses were conducted using different categories as referent groups to allow for comprehensive examination of the relationships between all groups. Results Marketing exposure was significantly correlated with a greater risk of single, dual, and polytobacco product use relative to nonusers. Relative to single product users, product marketing exposure was significantly correlated with a greater relative risk of dual and polytobacco use. There was no statistical difference in the association of marketing exposure between dual and polytobacco use, in any model. Conclusion A positive relationship between tobacco product marketing exposure and number of tobacco products used was observed. The magnitude of the relationship grew from single product to dual/poly use. Restrictions of marketing of all tobacco products, similar to cigarettes, particularly in the retail setting, should be considered. Implications This study has two primary public health implications. First, self-reported exposure to tobacco/e-cigarette marketing is widespread among adolescents of all tobacco product categories. Second, this widespread exposure to tobacco/e-cigarette marketing appears to not only be correlated with use of a single tobacco product (eg, cigarettes, e-cigarettes), but also multiple tobacco products. While longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate the relationships observed in this study, findings justify further study given the known relationship between tobacco marketing exposure and subsequent cigarette use.

2105,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Cardiovascular Effects of Hookah Smoking: Potential Implications for Cardiovascular Risk,article,"Introduction Smoking is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hookah (ie, waterpipe) smoking is a centuries-old revived yet understudied global epidemic of tobacco use. Because of the traditional set-up of a hookah-pipe, in addition to inhaling tobacco-combustion products, smokers are also exposed to large amounts of charcoal combustion products from the burning charcoal briquettes used to heat the hookah flavored tobacco. Despite being heavily advertised and actively glamorized in the mass media as a healthier tobacco alternative, the toxicological constituents of hookah smoke—including nicotine, carbon monoxide, particulates, oxidants, heavy metals, phenols and flavorants—indicate the potential to cause adverse cardiovascular events. Methods Herein, we review evidence on hookah smoke toxicological constituents, cardiovascular effects and potential mechanisms by which hookah smoke aerosol could cause cardiovascular disease. Results The evidence reviewed here indicates that contrary to the widespread popular belief that hookah is a healthier tobacco alternative, the constituents of hookah smoke aerosol contains similar chemicals compared to cigarette smoke, many of which are known to be harmful to cardiovascular health and mediated by similar pathophysiologic processes. Because the burning charcoal briquettes are a unique source of toxicant emissions specific to hookah smoking, some constituents differ in their quantities from cigarettes with some of their cardiovascular effects unknown. Conclusions To date, much more is known about the constituents and their toxicology than about the effects of hookah smoking on human cardiovascular health. Further research on long-term consequences of hookah use is needed. Implications This review provides an overview on the potential impact of hookah smoking on cardiovascular health. Readers will gain an insight into evidence on its toxicological constituents, human health effects, and pathophysiological mechanisms by which hookah smoking might cause cardiovascular disease. The review also highlights current research gaps regarding the cardiovascular consequences of hookah smoking, specifically the long-term consequences in the United States and Europe among flavored-hookah tobacco users.

2603,Tobacco Induced Diseases,2018,Effects of a natural polyphenol on nicotine-induced pancreatic cancer cell proliferation,RESEARCH PAPER,"First Paragraph: Resveratrol, a naturally occurring phytoalexin and a phenolic compound found in grape skins, mulberries, and certain nuts, is anti-tumorigenic, anti-inflammatory1-3 and possess antioxidant properties1,4. Resveratrol acts also as a potential cardio-protective agent as it was shown that red wine consumption (a source of resveratrol) is inversely related to cardiovascular disease5,6. Besides cardioprotective effects, resveratrol exhibits anticancer activities through a variety of regulatory pathways7-10, as documented in several reviews1,2,11,12. In vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed that resveratrol can modulate multiple pathways involved in cell growth, apoptosis, and inflammation13-15. Yet, the mechanism aspects of this polyphenol are not completely understood and still under considerable investigation. Jang et al.3 reported that chemo-preventative activity of resveratrol may involve three major phases, such as inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and decreases in cancer progression. Although multiple pathways towards those mechanisms have been investigated16-18, the precise mechanism of the anti-proliferative effects of resveratrol, in particular reference to pancreatic cancer, has not been fully evaluated. Golkar et al.7 demonstrated that resveratrolinduced growth inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated in part by up-regulation of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1).

1660,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Comparison of the Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence and the Heaviness of Smoking Index in the Second and Third Trimester of Pregnancy,article,"Introduction Smoking cessation at any stage of pregnancy can benefit the mother and fetus. Cigarette dependence is a significant factor in women who continue to smoke during pregnancy and accurate assessment of cigarette dependence can be helpful in planning smoking cessation programs. The objective of our study was to investigate the validity of the Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) and Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI) as measures of cigarette dependence in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy by comparing them to serum cotinine levels. Methods Prospective cohort study of 167 women in their second and third trimester of pregnancy who self-reported cigarette smoking. They were administered the FTCD questionnaire and blood was drawn for cotinine measurements using a direct enzyme linked immunoassay. Linear regression was used to adjust for maternal age, body mass index, gestation, and parity to investigate the association between cotinine levels and the two scores. Results Both the FTCD and HSI correlated significantly with serum cotinine levels (Spearman coefficient 0.42 and 0.37, respectively, p < .001). The correlation coefficients of both scores were higher in primigravidas (n = 51) compared to multigravidas, but the difference was statistically nonsignificant. Using multiple linear regression, both scores were significantly related to serum cotinine levels. For each unit increase in the FTCD and HSI, the serum cotinine level increased by 21.4 ng/mL (95% confidence interval 10.1–32.7, p <0.001) and 37 ng/mL (95% confidence interval 18.6–55.4, p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions Both the FTCD and HSI can be used to assess cigarette dependence in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Implications There is lack of data on the validity of the FTCD and the HSI as markers of cigarette dependence during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Our study suggests that both the FTCD and HSI perform well in assessing cigarette dependence in the second and third trimester of pregnancy and can be used to plan smoking cessation programs.

2367,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Opioid Use and Rate of Nicotine Metabolism Among Pregnant Smokers,article,"Introduction Smokers who use opioids smoke more cigarettes per day (CPD) than non-opioid users, which could be due to the effects of opioids on nicotine metabolism. Moreover, nicotine metabolism increases during pregnancy, potentially making quitting more difficult for pregnant smokers. We examined nicotine metabolism and its association with opioid use (OU) and CPD in pregnant smokers. Methods We recruited pregnant women who smoked at least 5 CPD for a clinical trial of smoking cessation. Plasma nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC)/cotinine)—a biomarker of nicotine metabolism—OU (involving methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, or tramadol), and CPD were assessed at baseline. We used linear regression to examine the associations between log-transformed NMR, OU, and CPD, adjusting for race/ethnicity and menthol smoking. Results Among 129 pregnant smokers, 25 (19%) were opioid users; most were maintained on methadone (n = 14). Compared to non-OU smokers, OU smokers had higher median CPD (10.0 vs. 7.0, p = .0007), serum 3HC (81.0 vs. 42.0 ng/mL, p = .0001), and NMR (0.63 vs. 0.43, p < .0001). In addition, methadone-maintained smokers had a higher median NMR than non-OU smokers (0.66 vs. 0.43, p = .0004). Adjusting for covariates, log-transformed NMR was greater in OU smokers (p = .012), specifically methadone-maintained smokers (p = .024), than non-OU smokers. Conclusions Our preliminary results show that OU is associated with a higher NMR in pregnant smokers. A larger study sample is needed to replicate this finding, examine potential mechanisms, and determine its clinical significance. Implications Among pregnant smokers, we observed that nicotine metabolism was significantly faster among opioid users—the majority of whom were on methadone maintenance—compared to nonusers, which could have implications for smoking cessation. Further studies are needed to replicate this finding, evaluate potential mechanisms, and determine its clinical significance.

1346,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Association of Cigarette Smoking With Interpersonal and Self-Directed Violence in a Large Community-Based Sample,article,"Introduction: Substance use is a major risk factor for various forms of violence, yet how cigarette smoking influences violence outcomes is incompletely understood. We investigated associations between cigarette smoking and three types of violence in a large, nationally representative, community-based sample. Methods: Adult subjects participating in both Wave 1 (2001–2002; N = 43 093) and Wave 2 (2004–2005; N = 34 653) of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were stratified by daily cigarette smoking status at Wave 1, and individuals with unchanged smoking status between waves were analyzed (nonsmokers [consisting of never and former daily smokers]: N = 22 529; daily smokers: N = 7442). We created composites of other- and self-directed violence and victimization occurring between Waves 1 and 2, and performed logistic regression models, controlling for psychiatric diagnoses, alcohol and substance use, and relevant demographic covariates. Results: Daily smokers at Wave 1 were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.5–3.0), 2.5 (2.1–2.9), and 1.7 (1.5–2.1) times more likely than nonsmokers to report self-directed violence, other-directed violence, or victimization between Waves 1 and 2, respectively. Former daily smokers were significantly less likely to report other-directed violence than individuals who were never daily smokers. Conclusions: Daily cigarette smoking is temporally associated with multiple forms of violence compared to never and former cigarette smokers, even when common covariates associated with violence are controlled. Smoking status should be carefully controlled for in studies designed to identify risk factors for violence, and may be a useful component of violence risk assessment. Implications: The findings suggest that cigarette smoking status should be carefully and systematically controlled for in studies of violence risk factors. The findings also support further investigation of the utility of cigarette smoking status for violence risk assessment, and whether smoking cessation strategies mitigate violence risk.

Methods We analyzed biomarker of exposure data by smoking status from over 1100 adult exclusive daily cigarette smokers in Wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study who were either exclusive daily smokers or had quit tobacco use entirely at Wave 2. Wave 1 smoking categories consisted of “very light” (1–4 CPD), “light” (5–9 CPD), “moderate” (10–19 CPD), and “heavy” (20+ CPD), and Wave 2 categories were “quitters” (stopped smoking entirely), exclusive cigarette “reducers” (CPD decreased ≥ 50%), “maintainers” (CPD within 50%–150% of Wave 1 value), and “increasers” (CPD increased ≥ 50%). Results Complete quitters had significantly lower levels of TNE-2, NNAL, NNN, 2-Fluorene, HPMA, CYMA, and MHB3 at Wave 2 for all Wave 1 CPD categories, and decreases were often large. Moderate “reducers” had lower levels of NNAL and 1-Hydroxypyrene at Wave 2, and heavy “reducers” had lower levels of NNAL, 2-Fluorene, and MHB3. Light “increasers” had higher levels of TNE-2, NNAL, 2-Fluorene, CYMA, and cadmium at Wave 2, and heavy “increasers” had higher levels of NNAL and HPMA. Conclusions Smoking “reducers” and “increasers” had changes in some biomarker of tobacco exposure levels, but reductions were much greater and more consistent for complete quitters. Implications PATH longitudinal cohort study data show that some exclusive daily cigarette smokers increase or decrease CPD over time. These differences may result in moderate changes in the levels of some biomarkers such as NNAL. Even so, however, reductions in biomarker levels are much greater with complete smoking cessation.

Preclinical data suggest that it may also be effective in smoking cessation through modulation of the dopaminergic reward system. Methods This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 30 centers in the United States. Six hundred three adult smokers with a Body Mass Index of 18.5–35 kg/m2, averaging at least 10 cigarettes/day with no period of abstinence >3 months for the past year were randomized to lorcaserin 10 mg once daily (QD), 10 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo; all received standardized smoking cessation counseling weekly. The target quit date was day 15. The primary endpoint was the exhaled carbon monoxide confirmed Continuous Abstinence Rate for weeks 9–12 (month 3). Results Continuous Abstinence Rates for month 3 were 5.6%, 8.7%, and 15.3% for the placebo, QD and BID groups, respectively (BID vs. placebo odds ratio 3.02, 95% confidence interval 1.47, 6.22, p = .0027. Change in weight at week 12 (randomized population) was −0.01, −0.35 and −0.98 kg, respectively (p = .0004, BID vs. placebo), and +0.73, +0.76, and −0.41 kg in participants achieving month 3 continuous abstinence. The most frequent adverse events were headache, nausea, constipation, and fatigue. Conclusions Lorcaserin with counseling was associated with dose-related increases in smoking cessation and prevention of associated weight gain over a 3-month period. Further investigation of lorcaserin in smoking cessation is warranted. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT02044874 Implications This randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that lorcaserin used in conjunction with standard cessation counseling was associated with dose-related increases in smoking cessation and prevention of associated weight gain.

1457,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Adolescents’ Perceptions of an On-cigarette Health Warning,article,"Introduction In most countries, health warnings have been on cigarette packs for decades. We explored adolescents’ perceptions of a health warning on cigarettes. Methods Data come from the 2014 wave of a cross-sectional in-home survey with 11- to 16-year olds (N = 1205) from across the UK, with participants recruited from the general population using random location quota sampling. Participants were shown an image of a standard cigarette which displayed the warning “Smoking kills” and asked whether they thought this would (not) put people off starting to smoke, (not) make people want to give up smoking, and whether all cigarettes should (not) have health warnings on them. Results Most (71%) thought that an on-cigarette warning would put people off starting, although this decreased with age. Never smokers were more likely than current smokers to think that it would put people off starting. Approximately half (53%) thought that an on-cigarette warning would make people want to give up smoking, with this higher for never smokers and experimenters/past smokers than for current smokers. Most (85%) supported a warning on all cigarettes. There was support among each smoking group, although this was higher for never smokers and experimenters/past smokers than for current smokers, and higher for those indicating that most of their close friends do not smoke than for those indicating that most of their close friends do smoke. Conclusions The perception among adolescents that an on-cigarette warning could deter smoking, and the high support for a warning on all cigarettes, warrants further research. Implications Research on dissuasive cigarettes is at a nascent stage. This is the first study to explore how adolescents perceive a health warning (“Smoking kills”) on cigarettes. Almost three quarters of participants indicated that on-cigarette health warnings would deter people from starting to smoke, and 85% supported the inclusion of a warning on all cigarettes. While further research is clearly needed, these findings suggest that the inclusion of health warnings on cigarettes is considered appropriate by young people and may have a dissuasive effect.

1509,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Reduced Exposure to Harmful and Potentially Harmful Smoke Constituents With the Tobacco Heating System 2.1,article,"Introduction: Heating rather than burning tobacco reduces levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents, and consumer products using this approach aim to reduce exposure to tobacco toxicants. The Tobacco Heating System (THS) version 2.1 has been enhanced from earlier prototypes with an improved heat control and sensorial experience and thereby user acceptance. Exposure measurements are required to determine whether it may be possible to reduce the individual health risk compared to smoking combustible cigarettes (CCs). Methods: This controlled clinical study randomly assigned 40 smokers to either a group continuing to use of their own CC brand (n = 20) or a group switching to THS 2.1 (n = 20) for 5 days. Biomarkers of exposure were measured at baseline and on day 1 through day 5. Product consumption, Human Puffing Topography, the occurrence of adverse events, and an assessment of subjective effects, such as smoking satisfaction and enjoyment of respiratory tract sensations, were also determined. Results: The group of smokers who switched to THS 2.1 adapted their puffing behavior initially through longer puff duration and more puffs. During the duration of the study, total puff volume returned to baseline levels and the mean daily product consumption increased but with similar nicotine exposure compared to baseline CC use. Biomarkers of exposure to tobacco smoke toxicants which inform product risk assessment were significantly reduced with THS use compared to the CC group. THS 2.1 users experienced less reinforcing effects with THS 2.1 than with their own cigarette brand. Conclusions: THS 2.1 is a promising alternative to smoking CCs. Notwithstanding possible use adaption through consumption or puffing behavior, the exposure to harmful smoke constituents was markedly reduced with the new heated tobacco platform. Implications: Exposure markers to harmful and potentially harmful smoke constituents were lowered with the THS 2.1. Heating tobacco instead of burning can offer a potentially lower risk of delivering nicotine compared to CCs.

In this study, we explored effects of waterpipe smoking on pregnancy outcomes in rats. Methods: Animals were exposed to waterpipe tobacco smoking using a whole body exposure system 2 hours per day during pregnancy. A control group was exposed to fresh air only. Results:  The results showed significant association between exposure to waterpipe smoke during pregnancy and low birth weight ( P < .01) and neonatal death ( P < .01). In addition, the rate of growth of offspring of the waterpipe group was significantly lower than that of control group as measured by body weight gain during the first 3 months of life ( P < .001). No effect was found for waterpipe smoking on mean number of progeny and male to female ratio among offspring.  Conclusion: Waterpipe smoking is associated with adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes. Implications: In this study, we investigated for the first time the effect of waterpipe smoking on pregnancy outcomes using animal model.

939,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Preliminary Evaluation of a New German Translated Tobacco Quality of Life Impact Tool to Discriminate Between Healthy Current and Former Smokers and to Explore the Effect of Switching Smokers to a Reduced Toxicant Prototype Cigarette,article,"Background: Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is well established in clinical research, but ceiling effects in validated tools might prevent detection of changes in well respondents. Tobacco Quality of Life Impact Tool (TQOLITv1) uses conceptual and psychometric advances to enhance detection of HRQoL changes. Methods: In a 6-month, forced-switch study, the German TQOLITv1 was assessed in healthy adult (age 23–55 years) current and matched former-smokers. At baseline, smokers were switched to reduced toxicant prototype (RTP) or conventional cigarette for 6 months. TQOLITv1 responses were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months from current smokers whilst former smokers completed it at the latter two time points. TQOLITv1 includes SF-36v2 and new smoking-specific, physical and general-health measures. Results:  Reliability at baseline was good (Cronbach’s coefficient alpha > 0.70) for all measures. The baseline percentage with the best possible score (ceiling effect) for former and current smokers was substantially better for the new physical function than SF-36 physical function measure (35% vs. 59% at ceiling, respectively). New smoking-specific measures discriminated current from former smokers better than general health measures. Smoking-specific symptoms ( r = 0.73) were more stable from baseline to 6 months than other measures ( r = 0.38–0.54) particularly more than the SF-36 mental component score ( r = 0.24). Although both product smoking groups worsened in most HRQoL measures, changes in general and smoking-specific HRQoL impact measures favored RTP smokers.  Conclusions: The German TQOLITv1 is sufficiently reliable and valid to assess HRQoL and may be more useful than SF-36v2 in evaluation of interventions in well smoking populations including those consuming RTPs.

2390,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,"Similarities and Differences Between Sexes and Countries in the Mortality Imprint of the Smoking Epidemic in 34 Low-Mortality Countries, 1950–2014",article,"Introduction The smoking epidemic greatly affected mortality levels and trends, especially among men in low-mortality countries. The objective of this article was to examine similarities and differences between sexes and low-mortality countries in the mortality imprint of the smoking epidemic. This will provide important additions to the smoking epidemic model, but also improve our understanding of the differential impact of the smoking epidemic, and provide insights into its future impact. Methods Using lung-cancer mortality data for 30 European and four North American or Australasian countries, smoking-attributable mortality fractions (SAMF) by sex, age (35–99), and year (1950–2014) were indirectly estimated. The timing and level of the peak in SAMF35-99, estimated using weighting and smoothing, were compared. Results Among men in all countries except Bulgaria, a clear wave pattern was observed, with SAMF35-99 peaking, on average, at 33.4% in 1986. Eastern European men experienced the highest (40%) and Swedish men the lowest (16%) peak. Among women, SAMF35-99 peaked, on average, at 18.1% in 2007 in the North American/Australasian countries and five Northwestern European countries, and increased, on average, to 7.5% in 2014 in the remaining countries (4% in Southern and Eastern Europe). The average sex difference in the peak is at least 25.6 years in its timing and at most 22.9 percentage points in its level. Conclusions Although the progression of smoking-attributable mortality in low-mortality countries was similar, there are important unexpected sex and country differences in the maximum mortality impact of the smoking epidemic driven by cross-country differences in economic, political, and emancipatory progress. Implications The formal, systematic, and comprehensive analysis of similarities and differences between sexes and 34 low-mortality countries in long-term time trends (1950–2014) in smoking-attributable mortality provided important additions to the Global Burden of Disease study and the descriptive smoking epidemic model (Lopez et al.). Despite a general increase followed by a decline, the timing of the maximum mortality impact differs more between sexes than previously anticipated, but less between regions. The maximum mortality impact among men differs considerably between countries. The observed substantial diversity warrants country-specific tobacco control interventions and increased attention to the current or expected higher smoking-attributable mortality shares among women compared to men.

1434,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Effects of 6-Week Use of Reduced-Nicotine Content Cigarettes in Smokers With and Without Elevated Depressive Symptoms,article,"Background: The FDA recently acquired regulatory authority over tobacco products, leading to renewed interest in whether reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes would reduce tobacco dependence in the United States. Given the association between depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking, it is important to consider whether smokers with elevated depressive symptoms experience unique benefits or negative consequences of nicotine reduction. Methods: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that examined the effects of cigarettes varying in nicotine content over a 6-week period in non-treatment-seeking smokers, we used linear regression to examine whether baseline depressive symptom severity (scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]) moderated the effects of reduced-nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes, relative to normal-nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes, on smoking rates, depressive symptom severity, and related subjective and physiological measures. Results: Of the 717 participants included in this analysis, 109 (15.2%) had CES-D scores ≥ 16, indicative of possible clinical depression. Relative to NNC cigarettes, RNC cigarettes reduced smoking rates, nicotine dependence, and cigarette craving, and these effects were not significantly moderated by baseline CES-D score. A significant interaction between baseline CES-D score and cigarette condition on week 6 CES-D score was observed (p < .05); among those with CES-D scores ≥ 16 at baseline, those assigned to RNC cigarettes had lower week 6 CES-D scores than those assigned to NNC cigarettes. Among those in the lowest nicotine content conditions, biochemically confirmed compliance with the RNC cigarettes was associated with an increase in CES-D score for those with baseline CES-D scores < 16 and no change in CES-D score for those with baseline CES-D scores ≥ 16. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that a reduced-nicotine standard for cigarettes may reduce smoking, without worsening depressive symptoms, among smokers with elevated depressive symptoms. Implications: This secondary analysis of a recent clinical trial examined whether depressive symptom severity moderated the effects of reduced-nicotine cigarettes on smoking and depressive symptoms. Results indicate that, regardless of baseline depressive symptoms, participants randomized to reduced-nicotine cigarettes had lower smoking rates, nicotine intake, nicotine dependence, and craving at week 6 post-randomization than those assigned to normal-nicotine cigarettes. In participants with higher baseline depressive symptoms, those assigned to reduced-nicotine cigarettes had lower week 6 depressive symptoms than those assigned to normal-nicotine cigarettes. These results suggest that a nicotine reduction policy could have beneficial effects for smokers, regardless of depressive symptom severity.

1661,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2017,Prevalence and Correlates of Late Initiation of Smokeless Tobacco in US Firefighters,article,"Introduction Prevalence rates of smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and late initiation among firefighters (ie, starting use as an adult after joining the fire service) are remarkably high, 10.5% and 26.0%, respectively. The purpose of this study is to examine characteristics associated with late SLT initiation in a sample comprised of male career firefighters from two large cohort studies. Methods We examined correlates of late SLT initiation in a secondary analysis of data combining the baseline evaluations of two published firefighter health studies with 1474 male career firefighters in the United States. Results Fourteen percent of participants were current SLT users. Among this group, the unadjusted rate of firefighters who initiated SLT use after joining the fire service was 15.9%, while the age-standardized rate was 38.2%; this is substantially higher than the national adjusted late initiation rate among adult males (0.8%). In addition, firefighters demonstrated higher rates of late SLT initiation (15.9% unadjusted; 18.4% age-standardized) when compared to males in the military overall (13.8%). Conclusions The exceptionally high prevalence of SLT use overall and late initiation in the fire service suggest that joining the fire service in the United States is a risk factor for SLT use. There is a need to develop interventions aimed at reducing SLT use in the fire service that are specifically tailored for this occupational group. Implications The high prevalence of late SLT initiation (ie, starting use as an adult after joining the fire service) among firefighters should be addressed by both researchers and fire service organizations given the significant health risks associated with SLT and its impact on occupational readiness. There is a need for developing intervention programs aimed at reducing SLT use in the fire service. Interventions would need to be specifically tailored for this occupational group and their unique culture, given that joining the fire service appears to be a risk factor for SLT initiation among firefighters who did not use tobacco prior to joining the fire service.

1055,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Working to Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities from Tobacco: A Review of the National Cancer Institute’s Community Networks Program,article,"Introduction: In 2005, the National Cancer Institute funded the Community Networks Program (CNP), which aimed to reduce cancer health disparities in minority racial/ethnic and underserved groups through community-based participatory research, education, and training. The purpose of this study was to describe the CNP model and their tobacco-related work in community-based research, education, and training using a tobacco disparities research framework. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of the CNP tobacco-related activities including publications, published abstracts, research activities, trainee pilot studies, policy-related activities, educational outreach, and reports produced from 2005–2009. Two authors categorized the tobacco-related activities and publications within the framework. Results: Although there was no mandate to address tobacco, the CNPs produced 103 tobacco-related peer-reviewed publications, which reflects the largest proportion (12%) of all CNP cancer-related publications. Selected publications and research activities were most numerous under the framework areas “Psychosocial Research,” “Surveillance,” “Epidemiology,” and “Treatment of Nicotine Addiction.” Thirteen CNPs participated in tobacco control policymaking in mainstream efforts that affected their local community and populations, and 24 CNPs conducted 1147 tobacco-related educational outreach activities. CNP activities that aimed to build research and infrastructure capacity included nine tobacco-related pilot projects representing 16% of all CNP cancer-related pilot projects, and 17 publications acknowledging leveraged partnerships with other organizations, a strategy encouraged by the CNP. Conclusions: The CNP is a promising academic-community model for working to eliminate tobacco-related health disparities. Future efforts may address scientific gaps, consider collaboration across groups, assess the extent of operationalizing community-based participatory research, and improve common tracking measures.

987,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2015,Systematic and Meta-Analytic Review of Research Examining the Impact of Menstrual Cycle Phase and Ovarian Hormones on Smoking and Cessation,article,"Introduction: To determine the effect of ovarian hormones on smoking, we conducted a systematic review of menstrual cycle effects on smoking (i.e., ad lib smoking, smoking topography, and subjective effects) and cessation-related behaviors (i.e., cessation, withdrawal, tonic craving, and cue-induced craving). Methods: Thirty-six papers were identified on MEDLINE that included a menstrual-related search term (e.g., menstrual cycle, ovarian hormones), a smoking-related search term (e.g., smoking, nicotine), and met all inclusion criteria. Thirty-two studies examined menstrual phase, 1 study measured hormone levels, and 3 studies administered progesterone. Results: Sufficient data were available to conduct meta-analyses for only 2 of the 7 variables: withdrawal and tonic craving. Women reported greater withdrawal during the luteal phase than during the follicular phase, and there was a nonsignificant trend for greater tonic craving in the luteal phase. Progesterone administration was associated with decreased positive and increased negative subjective effects of nicotine. Studies of menstrual phase effects on the other outcome variables were either small in number or yielded mixed outcomes. Conclusions: The impact of menstrual cycle phase on smoking behavior and cessation is complicated, and insufficient research is available upon which to conduct meta-analyses on most smoking outcomes. Future progress will require collecting ovarian hormone levels to more precisely quantify the impact of dynamic changes in hormone levels through the cycle on smoking behavior. Clarifying the relationship between hormones and smoking—particularly related to quitting, relapse, and medication response—could determine the best type and timing of interventions to improve quit rates for women.

2252,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Relationship Between Nicotine Intake and Reward Function in Rats With Intermittent Short Versus Long Access to Nicotine,article,"Introduction Tobacco use improves mood states and smoking cessation leads to anhedonia, which contributes to relapse. Animal studies have shown that noncontingent nicotine administration enhances brain reward function and leads to dependence. However, little is known about the effects of nicotine self-administration on the state of the reward system. Methods To investigate the relationship between nicotine self-administration and reward function, rats were prepared with intracranial self-stimulation electrodes and intravenous catheters. The rats were trained on the intracranial self-stimulation procedure and allowed to self-administer 0.03 mg/kg/infusion of nicotine. All rats self-administered nicotine daily for 10 days (1 hour/day) and were then switched to an intermittent short access (ShA, 1 hour/day) or long access (LgA, 23 hour/day) schedule (2 days/week, 5 weeks). Results During the first 10 daily, 1-hour sessions, nicotine self-administration decreased the reward thresholds, which indicates that nicotine potentiates reward function. After switching to the intermittent LgA or ShA schedule, nicotine intake was lower in the ShA rats than the LgA rats. The LgA rats increased their nicotine intake over time and they gradually consumed a higher percentage of their nicotine during the light phase. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine induced a larger increase in reward thresholds (ie, anhedonia) in the LgA rats than the ShA rats. In the LgA rats, nAChR blockade with mecamylamine decreased nicotine intake for 2 hours and this was followed by a rebound increase in nicotine intake. Conclusions A brief period of nicotine self-administration enhances reward function and a high level of nicotine intake leads to dependence. Implications These animal studies indicate that there is a strong relationship between the level of nicotine intake and brain reward function. A high level of nicotine intake was more rewarding than a low level of nicotine intake and nicotine dependence was observed after long, but not short, access to nicotine. This powerful combination of nicotine reward and withdrawal makes it difficult to quit smoking. Blockade of nAChRs temporarily decreased nicotine intake, but this was followed by a large rebound increase in nicotine intake. Therefore, nAChR blockade might not decrease the use of combustible cigarettes or electronic cigarettes.

130,Tobacco Control,2015,Health effects associated with waterpipe smoking,Research Article,"Objective It is widely held that waterpipe smoking (WPS) is not associated with health hazards. However, several studies have documented the uptake of several toxicants and carcinogens during WPS that is strongly associated with harmful health effects. This paper reviews the literature on the health effects of WPS. Data sources Three databases-PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE-were searched until August 2014 for the acute and long-term health effects of WPS using the terms ‘waterpipe’ and its synonyms (hookah, shisha, goza, narghileh, arghileh and hubble-bubble) in various spellings. Study selection We included original clinical studies, case reports and systematic reviews and focused on clinical human studies. ∼10% of the identified studies met the selection criteria. Data extraction Data were abstracted by all three authors and summarised into tables. Abstracted data included study type, results and methodological limitations and were analysed jointly by all three authors. Data synthesis WPS acutely leads to increased heart rate, blood pressure, impaired pulmonary function and carbon monoxide intoxication. Chronic bronchitis, emphysema and coronary artery disease are serious complications of long-term use. Lung, gastric and oesophageal cancer are associated with WPS as well as periodontal disease, obstetrical complications, osteoporosis and mental health problems. Conclusions Contrary to the widely held misconception, WPS is associated with a variety of adverse short-term and long-term health effects that should reinforce the need for stronger regulation. In addition, this review highlights the limitations of the published work, which is mostly cross-sectional or retrospective. Prospective studies should be undertaken to assess the full spectrum of health effects of WPS, particularly in view of its growing popularity and attractiveness to youth.

1288,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Dynamic Role of Urban Neighborhood Effects in a Text-Messaging Adolescent Smoking Intervention,article,"Introduction: Neighborhood features such as the density of tobacco outlets relative to one’s home and evaluations of safety of one’s activity space (routine locations), are known to influence health behaviors. Understanding the time-varying nature of these aspects of the urban ecology provides unique insights into the dynamic interactions of individuals and their environments. Methods: The present study tested the time-varying effects of tobacco outlets and perceived safety within a randomized controlled trial of an adolescent text-messaging smoking intervention. We used ecological momentary assessment data (EMA) from an automated text-messaging smoking cessation randomized trial with 197 primarily African American urban adolescents. We employed a time-varying effect model to estimate the effects of density of tobacco outlets within one-half mile of participants’ home locations (time-invariant covariate) and evaluations of safety of their activity space (time-varying covariate) on momentary smoking over 6 months by treatment condition. The time-varying effect model approach models behavioral change and associations of coefficients expressed dynamically and graphically represented as smooth functions of time. Results: Differences in trajectories of smoking between treatment conditions were apparent over the course of the study. During months 2 and 6, the association between tobacco outlet density and smoking was significantly stronger in the control condition, suggesting treatment dampens this association during these time periods. The intervention also significantly reduced the association of perceived safety and smoking among the treatment condition during months 3 through 6. Conclusions: Results support testing the time-varying effects of urban ecological features and perceptions of safety among adolescents in text-based smoking cessation interventions. Implications: This study makes a unique contribution towards understanding the time-varying effects of urban neighborhoods on adolescent tobacco use within the context of a text-delivered intervention. Helping to adjust the long-held conceptualization of intervention effects as a static outcome, to that of a dynamic, time-varying process, is an important contribution of this study. The ability to specify when behavioral change occurs within the context of a randomized control trial provides understanding into the time-varying treatment effects of text-based smoking intervention. For example, researchers can modify the intervention to have strategically timed booster sessions that align with when the odds of smoking begin to increase in order to provide more precise treatment. The current study results show that increasing support to participants during months 2 and 4 may help suppress smoking over the course of a 6-month intervention.

1953,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,How Much Is Too Much? Estimating Effective Price-Hikes to Affect Smoking Behavior in Vietnam,article,"Introduction Raising the price of cigarettes is one of the most effective strategies to reduce cigarette smoking. The Vietnamese government is working toward the tobacco control goal of a 10% reduction in smoking prevalence by 2020. However, cigarette prices in Vietnam have not increased in the last two decades. The aim of this study was to estimate what cigarette prices would make smokers attempt to quit smoking, and to identify predictors of the price to quit and the intention to quit. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 822 male current smokers in Da Nang, Vietnam. A structured questionnaire was adapted from the International Tobacco Control project survey. Bayesian quantile regression was applied to predict factors associated with expected cigarette price. Results Fifty-six percent of smokers suggested a price to quit. Their median suggested price to quit per pack, 62 000 VND (2.8 USD), was 2.8 times higher than the actual current price, 22 000 VND (1.01 USD). Suggesting a lower price to quit was significantly associated with awareness of warning labels and smoke-free policies. In contrast, being a heavy smoker was significantly associated with a higher suggested price to quit across all quantiles. Conclusions There may be sufficient room to increase cigarette prices in Vietnam. The price to quit is associated with various factors, including non-pricing policies. Implications Evidence suggests that a steep increase in cigarette prices, setting a high minimum tax, and introducing a large specific tax, which are policy-induced price increases that can raise prices substantially in Vietnam, are preferable strategies. In addition to increasing price and taxes, the government should also strengthen non-pricing policies.

2543,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2021,Vape Shop Owners/Managers’ Opinions About FDA Regulation of E-Cigarettes,article,"Introduction In the United States, prominent sources of vaping products are specialty vape shops, which are subject to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation. This study interviewed vape shop owners/managers to assess: (1) reasons for entering into or engaging in vape shop retail; (2) personnel training, particularly with regard to FDA and state regulations; and (3) how existing regulations are perceived and the anticipated impact of future regulation. Aims and Methods The current study involved phone–based semi-structured interviews of 45 vape shop owners/managers in six metropolitan statistical areas (Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego, and Seattle) during Summer 2018 as FDA regulations regarding minimum age verification, bans on product sampling, and health warnings (among others) were first being implemented. Results Vape shop owners/managers reported: (1) entering the industry with positive intentions for their customers, (2) training their personnel to adhere to regulations and provide good customer service, and (3) significant concerns about the impact of FDA regulations. With regard to the latter, participants reported mistrust of the intentions of the FDA regulations, financial implications of the regulations (particularly for small businesses), difficulty understanding and interpreting the regulations, insufficient evidence to support the regulations, negative impact on customer service, negative impact on product offerings and product innovation/advancement, and negative implications of flavor bans and/or restrictions on sale of flavors. Conclusions These findings indicate the complexities in implementing tobacco regulations, particularly from the perspective of the vape shop industry. Current findings should inform future regulatory actions and efforts to assess compliance with regulations. Implications Current and impending FDA regulation of vaping products present a critical period for examining regulatory impact on the vape shop industry. Current results indicated that many vape shop owners/managers reporting positive intentions for engaging in the vaping product industry and in training vape shop personnel to adhere to regulations. However, the majority reported concerns about FDA regulation and other state/local regulations that could have negative implications for their industry. Particular concerns include difficulty understanding the regulations due to complexity, vagueness, and changes in language and/or interpretation over time. These issues have implications for compliance that must be addressed.

26,Tobacco Control,2015,Understanding the emergence of the tobacco industry's use of the term tobacco harm reduction in order to inform public health policy,Research Article,"Objectives To explore the history of transnational tobacco companies’ use of the term, approach to and perceived benefits of ‘harm reduction’. Methods Analysis of internal tobacco industry documents, contemporary tobacco industry literature and 6 semistructured interviews. Results The 2001 Institute of Medicine report on tobacco harm reduction appears to have been pivotal in shaping industry discourse. Documents suggest British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International adopted the term ‘harm reduction’ from Institute of Medicine, then proceeded to heavily emphasise the term in their corporate messaging. Documents and interviews suggest harm reduction offered the tobacco industry two main benefits: an opportunity to (re-) establish dialogue with and access to policy makers, scientists and public health groups and to secure reputational benefits via an emerging corporate social responsibility agenda. Conclusions Transnational tobacco companies’ harm reduction discourse should be seen as opportunistic tactical adaptation to policy change rather than a genuine commitment to harm reduction. Care should be taken that this does not undermine gains hitherto secured in efforts to reduce the ability of the tobacco industry to inappropriately influence policy. ","The issue of cigarette branded snus appears to be debated within the tobacco industry. The Swedish Match interviewees noted that their market research indicates that full time snus consumers (including ex-smokers) do not want snus linked to cigarettes or smoking, and expressed discomfort about cigarette branded snus (interview January 2011). Similarly, the European Smokeless Tobacco Council interviewee claimed that cigarette branded snus had not succeeded in the Swedish market, and suggested that non-cigarette branded snus was better able to communicate a reduced risk message (interview November 2010). The BAT interviewee on the other hand reported that its decision to brand snus with a cigarette brand (ie, Lucky Strike and Peter Stuyvesant) had been based on advice from UK public health experts, who had argued that if BAT were to be serious about switching smokers from cigarettes to snus, they should put their biggest cigarette brand on it (interview, December 2010). Interestingly, Euromonitor 2009 sales data indicate that cigarette branded snus represented only 2% market share in Sweden,71 and 3.6% in Norway,72 with BAT's traditional snus brands (Granit and Mocca) showing slightly bigger growth than its Lucky Strike and Camel Snus. The ‘Clearing the Smoke’ study by the Institute of Medicine has been pivotal in shaping tobacco industry discourse on harm reduction. Transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) adopted the term ‘harm reduction’ in response to this study, and proceeded to heavily emphasise the term in corporate messaging. Apart from trying to make a safer cigarette, documents show that TTCs’ use of harm reduction was aimed to gain access to scientists, the public health community and policy makers, and rebuild its reputation as a responsible industry. Although we can't rule out the possibility of a genuine commitment to harm reduction, this study suggests that TTCs’ harm reduction discourse should be approached critically and seen as opportunistic tactical adaptation to policy change. This study underlines the importance of ensuring that the harm reduction debate does not allow TTCs to re-enter the policy area from which they have increasingly been excluded in line with Article 5.3 of WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

The Swedish Match interviewees noted that their market research indicates that full time snus consumers (including ex-smokers) do not want snus linked to cigarettes or smoking, and expressed discomfort about cigarette branded snus (interview January 2011). Similarly, the European Smokeless Tobacco Council interviewee claimed that cigarette branded snus had not succeeded in the Swedish market, and suggested that non-cigarette branded snus was better able to communicate a reduced risk message (interview November 2010). The BAT interviewee on the other hand reported that its decision to brand snus with a cigarette brand (ie, Lucky Strike and Peter Stuyvesant) had been based on advice from UK public health experts, who had argued that if BAT were to be serious about switching smokers from cigarettes to snus, they should put their biggest cigarette brand on it (interview, December 2010). Interestingly, Euromonitor 2009 sales data indicate that cigarette branded snus represented only 2% market share in Sweden,71 and 3.6% in Norway,72 with BAT's traditional snus brands (Granit and Mocca) showing slightly bigger growth than its Lucky Strike and Camel Snus. The ‘Clearing the Smoke’ study by the Institute of Medicine has been pivotal in shaping tobacco industry discourse on harm reduction. Transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) adopted the term ‘harm reduction’ in response to this study, and proceeded to heavily emphasise the term in corporate messaging. Apart from trying to make a safer cigarette, documents show that TTCs’ use of harm reduction was aimed to gain access to scientists, the public health community and policy makers, and rebuild its reputation as a responsible industry. Although we can't rule out the possibility of a genuine commitment to harm reduction, this study suggests that TTCs’ harm reduction discourse should be approached critically and seen as opportunistic tactical adaptation to policy change. This study underlines the importance of ensuring that the harm reduction debate does not allow TTCs to re-enter the policy area from which they have increasingly been excluded in line with Article 5.3 of WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

1721,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2018,Tobacco Consumption and Toxicant Exposure of Cigarette Smokers Using Electronic Cigarettes,article,"Background There is considerable debate about the benefits and risks of electronic cigarettes (ECs). To better understand the risk–benefit ratio of ECs, more information is needed about net nicotine consumption and toxicant exposure of cigarette smokers switching to ECs. Methods Forty cigarette smokers (≥1 year of smoking) interested in switching to ECs but not necessarily quitting smoking were enrolled in a 4-week observational study and provided an e-Go C non-variable battery and refillable atomizers and choice of eight flavors in 12 or 24 mg nicotine dosage. Measurement of urinary cotinine (metabolite of nicotine), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL; a pulmonary carcinogen), and eight volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are toxic tobacco smoke constituents was conducted at baseline and week 4. Results All participants with follow-up data (92.5%) reported using the study EC. Of the 40 smokers, 16 reported no cigarettes at week 2 (40%) and six continued to report no cigarettes at week 4 (15%). Change in nicotine intake over the 4 weeks was non-significant (p = .90). Carbon monoxide (p < .001), NNAL (p < .01) and metabolites of benzene (p < .01) and acrylonitrile (p = .001) were significantly decreased in the study sample. Smokers switching exclusively to ECs for at least half of the study period demonstrated significant reductions in metabolites of ethylene oxide (p = .03) and acrylamide (p < .01). Conclusion Smokers using ECs over 4 weeks maintained cotinine levels and experienced significant reductions in carbon monoxide, NNAL, and two out of eight measured VOC metabolites. Those who switched exclusively to ECs for at least half of the study period significantly reduced two additional VOCs. Implications This study extends current literature by measuring change in smoking dependence and disease-associated biomarkers, NNAL and a panel of eight common VOCs that are toxic tobacco smoke constituents in smokers who switch to ECs. The findings support the idea of harm reduction, however some levels of toxicant exposure are still of clinical concern, particularly for dual users. Extrapolation of these results must be careful to separate the different toxic exposure results for exclusive switchers versus dual cigarette + EC users, and not to equate harm reduction with the idea that using ECs is harmless.

1305,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016,Zonisamide Reduces Withdrawal Symptoms But Does Not Enhance Varenicline-Induced Smoking Cessation,article,"Introduction: Varenicline (Chantix) is a first-line treatment for smoking cessation but does not produce cessation in many individuals. It may be possible to improve abstinence by co-administering varenicline with other medications. Zonisamide (Zonegran) has a similar pharmacologic profile to topiramate, which has been shown to reduce smoking, but is better tolerated. This study evaluated whether combined zonisamide and varenicline reduced tobacco withdrawal and increased abstinence among smokers trying to quit, relative to varenicline and placebo. Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial of zonisamide + varenicline versus placebo + varenicline for smoking cessation. Smokers received brief counseling and study medications, and completed weekly assessments for 10 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome was continuous abstinence rates (biochemically verified) during the final 4 weeks of treatment. Results: Results are presented as intent-to-treat and completer analyses. Seventy-four individuals were enrolled; 45 completed the study. Overall, 14.9% (intent-to-treat) and 25.0% (completer) of participants maintained sustained abstinence during the final 4 weeks of treatment. There were no differences between groups for biochemically-verified smoking, but zonisamide + varenicline reduced self-reported smoking, nicotine withdrawal, and craving compared to placebo + varenicline. Conclusions: Zonisamide decreased nicotine withdrawal and craving, though not of sufficient magnitude to modify smoking behavior. The sample size was small and low rates of abstinence across groups suggest the study population was difficult to treat. Additional evaluation of zonisamide or other medications that increase GABA or decrease glutamate in larger or more diverse populations may yield positive clinical benefit for nicotine/tobacco cessation. Implications: This study provides support for layering novel medications with varenicline for smoking cessation, for investigating medications that target the GABA and glutamate system, and for assessing the contribution that reductions in nicotine withdrawal have on ultimate cessation outcomes.

2366,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2020,Implementing and Evaluating a Mentor Training to Improve Support for Early-Career Scholars in Tobacco Regulatory Science,article,"Introduction To implement and evaluate a blended online and in-person training to help mentors of early-career researchers appreciate the complexities of Tobacco Regulatory Science (TRS), refine TRS mentoring skills, and become acquainted with resources for providing effective guidance to TRS mentees. Methods TRS mentors engaged in a two-part pilot test of the training program. Authors evaluated both the online and in-person training using retrospective pre-post evaluations, which measure learning at the conclusion of a training program, and post-program focus groups. Twenty learners completed the online training, and 16 learners attended the in-person training module. Nine participants completed evaluations for the online module, and 12 participants completed evaluations for the in-person module. Results Program assessments revealed that participants found that the training achieved its overall goals. The majority of respondents (87.5%) rated the online portion of the training as valuable. For the in-person training, participants reported statistically significant improvements regarding confidence in: helping mentees to identify skills and training to effectively pursue TRS, assisting mentees in weighing career trajectories, and guiding mentees in conducting research responsive to TRS regulatory priorities. Conclusions The novel mentoring program was well received by faculty seeking to strengthen skills for mentoring early-career TRS researchers to navigate the complex landscape of TRS, explore diverse funding opportunities, and discern potential career trajectories. It provided unique content to address issues outside the traditional tobacco research training curriculum and offered specific information on regulatory policies, priorities, and opportunities. Implications This research documents the deployment and evaluation of a blended online and in-person training program for investigators mentoring early-career researchers working in TRS. Our assessment discovered that participants found the training to be valuable to their overall mentoring objectives. The training comprises a novel curriculum for investigators engaged in mentoring early-career researchers in a unique field, thus filling a deficit in the published literature by presenting a curriculum that has been customized to the unique needs of TRS mentors.

Sweet flavours contribute to the appeal of WPT and are a potential regulatory target. This study investigated use, preferences and perceptions of WPT flavours in pregnant WPT users, and the impact of flavour preferences on preconception/prenatal WPT use and exposure biomarkers. Methods 58 pregnant WPT users (mean age=27 years) completed a detailed interview regarding their WPT flavours use, preferences and perceptions. Biomarkers of nicotine and carcinogen exposure (eg, cotinine, benzene, butadiene) were also collected. Results 55% of participants were dual/poly WPT users (ie, reported use of one or more other tobacco products in addition to WPT). Pregnant WPT users reported nearly exclusive use of flavoured WPT, with greater use of menthol/mint (68%) followed by fruit flavours (48%) (p<0.001), and greater preferences for fruit followed by menthol/mint flavours (ps<0.05). Harm perceptions did not differ among flavours. Compared with dual/poly WPT users, WPT-only users reported more total WPT use events, greater use of and preference for menthol/mint flavoured WPT (ps<0.001), and decreased exposure biomarkers (ps≤0.040). Preference for menthol/mint and fruit flavours predicted more flavoured WPT use events during preconception and pregnancy; preference for menthol/mint predicted detectable cotinine and benzene levels but not butadiene.

335,Tobacco Control,2017,Tobacco outlet density and converted versus native non-daily cigarette use in a national US sample,Research Article,"Objective Investigate whether non-daily smokers’ (NDS) cigarette price and purchase preferences, recent cessation attempts, and current intentions to quit are associated with the density of the retail cigarette product landscape surrounding their residential address. Participants Cross-sectional assessment of N=904 converted NDS (CNDS). who previously smoked every day, and N=297 native NDS (NNDS) who only smoked non-daily, drawn from a national panel. Outcome measures Kernel density estimation was used to generate a nationwide probability surface of tobacco outlets linked to participants’ residential ZIP code. Hierarchically nested log-linear models were compared to evaluate associations between outlet density, non-daily use patterns, price sensitivity and quit intentions. Results Overall, NDS in ZIP codes with greater outlet density were less likely than NDS in ZIP codes with lower outlet density to hold 6-month quit intentions when they also reported that price affected use patterns (G2=66.1, p<0.001) and purchase locations (G2=85.2, p<0.001). CNDS were more likely than NNDS to reside in ZIP codes with higher outlet density (G2=322.0, p<0.001). Compared with CNDS in ZIP codes with lower outlet density, CNDS in high-density ZIP codes were more likely to report that price influenced the amount they smoke (G2=43.9, p<0.001), and were more likely to look for better prices (G2=59.3, p<0.001). NDS residing in high-density ZIP codes were not more likely to report that price affected their cigarette brand choice compared with those in ZIP codes with lower density. Conclusions This paper provides initial evidence that the point-of-sale cigarette environment may be differentially associated with the maintenance of CNDS versus NNDS patterns. Future research should investigate how tobacco control efforts can be optimised to both promote cessation and curb the rising tide of non-daily smoking in the USA. "," Findings from this work suggest that converted non-daily smokers (CNDS) are more likely to live in ZIP codes of higher tobacco outlet density than native NDS (NNDS), and that CNDS living in high-density ZIP codes are more likely to be price sensitive, as well as less likely to hold intentions to quit smoking in the near future than NNDS. Methodologically, this paper demonstrates the way information about the tobacco product landscape can be leveraged to improve our understanding of the complex association between tobacco product preferences and use patterns.

618,Tobacco Control,2019,Receipt of tobacco direct mail/email discount coupons and trajectories of cigarette smoking behaviours in a nationally representative longitudinal cohort of US adults,Research Article,"Background We assessed whether receipt of coupons—via direct mail or e-mail—was prospectively related to trajectories of smoking behaviours. Methods Data were from a cohort of US adults (n=26 447) who participated in wave 1 (2013–2014) and wave 2 (2014–2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. Participants reported receipt of tobacco direct mail/email coupons in the past 6 months in wave 1 and their smoking status in both waves. Weighted multiple logistic regressions were used to examine demographic correlates of receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons at wave 1 and to examine the prospective effect of receiving tobacco coupons on trajectories of smoking behaviours. Findings At wave 1, 10.7% of never smokers, 13.9% of experimental smokers, 37.1% of current smokers and 16.5% of former smokers reported receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons. Lower education and higher poverty adults and non-Hispanic white current smokers were more likely to have received these coupons (p<0.05). Receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons at wave 1 was associated with increased odds of smoking initiation among never smokers (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.83), becoming established smokers among experimenters (AOR=1.62, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.04), becoming daily smokers among non-daily smokers (AOR=1.56, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.99) and smoking relapse among former smokers between waves (AOR=1.91, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.65). Receiving these coupons at wave 1 was associated with reduced odds of smoking cessation ≥6 months among current smokers (AOR=0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88). Conclusions Tobacco direct mail/email coupons encourage and sustain smoking and disproportionately affect lower socioeconomic populations. ",Previous studies suggested receipt of tobacco direct mail/email coupons is associated with smoking behaviours. No studies to date have used a longitudinal design and a US nationally representative adult sample to examine how receiving tobacco coupons through direct mail/email influence smoking behaviours among adults at different stages of smoking behaviours.

2004,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2019,Temporal Trends of Sources of Cigarettes Among US High School Students: 2001–2015,article,"Introduction Restricting the supply of cigarettes to youth plays an important role in reducing youth smoking. Methods The study included data from 8 years of the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) from 2001 to 2015 with 99572 high school students less than 18 years old. Data were weighted to provide national estimates of the temporal trends of cigarette sources. Each cigarette source was analyzed by a separate multivariable logistic regression model and the linear trend odds ratio (aOR) was adjusted by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking frequency. Results The current smoking prevalence among US high school students less than 18 years of age declined from 26.9% in 2001 to 9.9% in 2015. Among current smokers, we found an overall downward trend of buying cigarettes in a store (aOR = 0.98, confidence interval [CI] = [0.96–1.00]) and an overall upward trend of getting them “some other way” (aOR = 1.03, CI = [1.01–1.05]). The prevalence of purchasing cigarettes in a store significantly declined among smokers aged 16–17, male smokers, white smokers, and daily smokers, but not among other categories. The prevalence of getting cigarettes “some other way” significantly increased across all groups except Hispanic smokers and medium-level or daily smokers. Conclusions The proportion of high school students reporting that they bought cigarettes from a store has been declining over the years, while the proportion of high schoolers reporting that they got cigarettes “some other way” has been increasing. The temporal trends also varied by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking frequency. Implications Patterns of high school student access to cigarettes have changed from 2001 to 2015, with access from “some other way” becoming more prevalent. The differences in cigarette acquisition by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking frequency highlight the importance of implementing tailored policies and interventions to reduce youth access to cigarettes and prevent youth from smoking.

227,Tobacco Control,2016,“Gone are the days of mass-media marketing plans and short term customer relationships”: tobacco industry direct mail and database marketing strategies,Research Article,"Background As limitations on traditional marketing tactics and scrutiny by tobacco control have increased, the tobacco industry has benefited from direct mail marketing which transmits marketing messages directly to carefully targeted consumers utilising extensive custom consumer databases. However, research in these areas has been limited. This is the first study to examine the development, purposes and extent of direct mail and customer databases. Methods We examined direct mail and database marketing by RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris utilising internal tobacco industry documents from the Legacy Tobacco Document Library employing standard document research techniques. Results Direct mail marketing utilising industry databases began in the 1970s and grew from the need for a promotional strategy to deal with declining smoking rates, growing numbers of products and a cluttered media landscape. Both RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris started with existing commercial consumer mailing lists, but subsequently decided to build their own databases of smokers’ names, addresses, brand preferences, purchase patterns, interests and activities. By the mid-1990s both RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris databases contained at least 30 million smokers’ names each. These companies valued direct mail/database marketing's flexibility, efficiency and unique ability to deliver specific messages to particular groups as well as direct mail's limited visibility to tobacco control, public health and regulators. Conclusions Database marketing is an important and increasingly sophisticated tobacco marketing strategy. Additional research is needed on the prevalence of receipt and exposure to direct mail items and their influence on receivers’ perceptions and smoking behaviours.
